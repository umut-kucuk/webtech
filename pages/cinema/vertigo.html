        <h3>By Koraljka Suton</h3>
        <p class="big-letter">
            It is no secret that the late Alfred Hitchcock was—and still is—not only one of the most revered filmmakers
            in
            the
            history of cinema, but also the <q>Master of Suspense.</q> After having started his career as a silent
            film title
            designer and art director, the London-born auteur had his directorial debut with the 1925 (silent) movie The
            Pleasure Garden and subsequently went on to make a number of films that would, after a mere few shots,
            become
            instantly recognizable as his. Dramatic shadows, unpredictable visual revelations and odd camera angles were
            all
            part of his repertoire, with the narrative of wrongfully accused people becoming a pervasive one throughout
            his
            career. He often told the story of how his father would treat him after he would misbehave during his
            childhood—the
            boy would be sent down to a police station with a note intended for the sergeant, asking him to lock the
            child
            up
            for the purpose of <q>teaching him a lesson.</q> As a result, an adult Hitchcock once said that he wanted
            the
            words
            You
            see what can happen if you are not a good boy engraved on his tombstone. It also made the subject matter of
            blameless people on the run into one of his favorite thematic elements. During his career that spanned six
            decades
            and included over fifty feature films, this wildly studied filmmaker earned forty-six Academy Award
            nominations
            and
            won a total of six times. By the year 1960, he had made four movies that are still regarded among the best
            of
            all
            time. One of them is, of course, the 1959 noir Vertigo (with the other three being Rear Window (1954), North
            by
            Northwest (1959) and Psycho (1960)). But the now-adored film was not always considered one of Hitchcock's
            masterpieces, quite the contrary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon Vertigo's release, critics were nowhere near impressed with the screenplay, finding the story
            unconvincing
            and
            farfetched, and audiences were not on board with either the mystery being resolved two-thirds into the movie
            or
            with
            watching Jimmy Stewart in a role very much unlike those they were used to seeing him in, such as that of
            J.B.
            <q>Jeff</q>
            Jefferies in Rear Window and Dr. Ben McKenna in The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956)—in both cases, viewers were
            quick
            to side with the main characters, which is not something that could be said for Stewart's John
            <q>Scottie</q>
            Ferguson in
            Vertigo, who made them feel all sorts of ambiguous ways. On top of that, the creation of suspense that
            Hitchcock's
            films became so known for was not the primary driving force of Vertigo, leaving audiences baffled and
            confused.
            But
            with the passing of time, the director's misunderstood gem finally got the recognition it had deserved all
            along—in
            1982, Vertigo entered the list of the ten greatest movies of all time published in the British Film
            Institute's
            magazine called Sight & Sound, and came in seventh place. By 2002, it ranked up, coming in a close second,
            and
            in
            the 2012 edition, it was voted into first place, dethroning the movie that had occupied that position since
            1962—Orson Welles' Citizen Kane. In 1989, it was deemed culturally, historically and aesthetically
            significant
            by
            the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

            Hitchcock wanted to buy the rights to a novel called Celle qui n'etait plus (translated into English as She
            Who
            Was
            No More) by writers Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, but unfortunately for him, director Henri-Georges
            Clouzot
            had beaten him to it and had directed the 1955 movie entitled Les Diaboliques based on said source material.
            The
            filmmaker was, therefore, very vigilant when it came to any new material written by the two—so when the
            follow-up
            D'entres les morts hit the bookstores in 1954, the director had Paramount commission a synopsis before the
            novel
            even got a chance to get translated into English. When the studio secured the rights, playwright Maxwell
            Anderson
            (Anne of the Thousand Days, The Bad Seed) got the job of adapting the novel into a film. Anderson wrote a
            script
            entitled Darkling, I Listen—a quote from English poet John Keats' poem Ode to a Nightingale—and Hitchcock
            did
            not
            like it one bit, so he discarded the draft and brought in Alec Coppel (The Captain's Paradise, Mr. Denning
            Drives
            North) instead. Unfortunately, his second pick did not satisfy him either, leading to Samuel L. Taylor
            (Avantil,
            Sabrina) being hired to write the screenplay from scratch, with the help of Hitchcock's notes. Taylor wanted
            to
            take
            sole credit for his work, but Coppel would not have it, and objected to the Screen Writers Guild, after
            which
            both
            were credited and Anderson was left out. Kim Novak was cast alongside Jimmy Stewart, although the part of
            the
            female
            lead was initially intended for Vera Miles, who would later on play her most memorable role in Psycho. Miles
            became
            pregnant so the director chose Novak instead. By the time the actress was ready to start shooting after
            having
            taken
            care of her other commitments, Miles became available again, only to find out that Hitchcock had decided to
            stick
            with his new leading lady.

        <p>
            Vertigo follows John <q>Scottie</q> Ferguson, a police officer who discovers he has a fear of heights that
            manifests
            itself as vertigo, forced to retire after his condition results in an unfortunate event taking place. He
            spends
            his
            time with his friend and ex-fiancée Marjorie <q>Midge</q> Wood (Barbara Bel Geddes), a smart and
            independent
            woman
            who
            obviously still has feelings for him. But Scottie's daily routine suddenly gets a bit more exciting when his
            old
            college friend Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) contacts him and asks for a very peculiar favor. Elster wants his
            wife
            Madeleine (Kim Novak) followed, but not because he suspects her of infidelity­—but rather because he is
            afraid
            for
            her mental health. Madeleine is presumably acting out the final days of her late great-grandmother's
            miserable
            life
            and Scottie becomes more than intrigued by the mysterious blond young woman who does not seem to know where
            she
            is
            going or what she is doing. Our protagonist soon finds himself enamored and unable to stay away, on the one
            hand
            desperately trying to get to the bottom of the mystery that is Madeleine and on the other reveling in it,
            for it
            is
            precisely the unknown about this woman that fuels his attraction turned obsession.

        <p class="big-letter">
            A shocking plot twist and resolution to the mystery that happens before the final third of the movie—the
            perceived
            premature reveal that left contemporary audiences dissatisfied—sets Scottie on a downward spiral that ends
            in
            his
            obsession taking control over both his actions and his life. For it is here that we clearly see the sad
            truth of
            a
            man in love with an untouchable fantasy, a phantasm in his head that no woman could ever live up to—not even
            the
            one
            he claims to be in love with. For the character of Madeleine is the epitome of the unknown woman, so
            mysterious,
            evasive and alluring that a person could project all of their deepest desires onto her, forever worshipping
            and
            feeling a miraculous pull towards the constructed image in their mind's eye, provided real facts about her
            remain
            obscured and she herself stay just slightly out of reach. Scottie's inability to fully understand Madeleine
            drives
            him mad with desire and gives rise to an urge within him—the urge to try. And when he does, it is to no
            avail,
            for
            his every attempt provides him with yet another intricate puzzle piece, the result being the opposite of
            driving
            him
            away. The more the truth evades him, the more obsessed he gets with getting to the bottom of Madeleine, but
            this
            is,
            in fact, a puzzle he subconsciously never wants solved, for that would imply his attraction ceasing to
            exist,
            and
            with it, his vertigo, which could be viewed as a metaphor for the loss of control and sense of
            disorientation
            experienced when falling hopelessly in love. And that is something Scottie cannot afford to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            On one level, Vertigo is a clever story about the factuality of the unrelenting male gaze that dominates and
            dictates both our shared collective reality and the majority of the narratives we as a species create and
            willingly
            consume, but it should also be viewed as a clever deconstruction of it. In depicting a man who, at a certain
            point
            in the film, controls what a woman should look like, how she should talk, walk and behave in order to adhere
            to
            his
            fantasy and cater to his gaze, Hitchcock unsubtly reveals his own obsession with controlling his actresses
            and
            his
            attempt at turning them into the perfect <q>Hitchcock blond.</q> As Kim Novak stated in a 1996 interview
            with
            Roger
            Ebert: Of course, in a way, that was how Hollywood treated its women in those days. I could really identify
            with
            (…) being pushed and pulled this way and that, being told what dresses to wear, how to walk, how to behave.
            I
            think
            there was a little edge in my performance that I was trying to suggest that I would not allow myself to be
            pushed
            beyond a certain point—that I was there, I was me, I insisted on myself. In other words, possessing a woman
            becomes
            an obsession in and of itself—and in obsessing, the man himself acts as if he were possessed. But on another
            level,
            Vertigo's male voyeur is actually the one who finds himself on the submissive side of this patriarchal
            powerplay—for
            he is not the one who controls the narrative, she is. Scottie is rendered powerless by the idealized and
            idolized
            fantasy in his mind, unaware of who the unknown woman really is and oblivious to what is actually taking
            place.
            She,
            on the other hand, is always one step ahead of him, counting on his gaze, attraction and urges to get both
            of
            them
            to where they need to be, if the plan they are a part of is to be played out as was intended. Ultimately,
            the
            final
            decision whether to stay or go was hers alone—she willed it so, knowingly and consciously, potential
            repercussions
            be damned.
        </p>
        <div class="full-width-image">

        </div>
        <p class="big-letter">
            The big revelation surrounding Madeleine's true identity, the aforementioned plot twist that many considered
            came
            much too early, was actually perfectly timed, for it provided us with a much-needed change of perspective.
            At
            first
            glance, it does seem to have taken the suspense out of the remainder of the story. But upon further
            inspection,
            it
            becomes evident that any other route would have deprived us of the experience of stepping into Madeleine's
            shoes. Up
            until then, we were in the same position as Scottie, equally baffled and confused, just as eager to solve
            the
            mystery at hand and gaze into the eyes of a woman in an attempt to uncover her secrets. But then we are
            suddenly
            gifted with an epiphany that Scottie is not privy to, and our being in the know creates another type of
            suspense—having explored both Scottie and Madeleine's internal worlds, we get to watch them clash and
            collide,
            painstakingly aware of the tragic implications that permeate the core of their relationship drenched in
            illusion
            which, therefore, neither can, nor ever will be based in truth and authenticity. The suspense is a deeply
            emotional
            one, for our own disillusionment leads to us clearly seeing the depths of Scottie's delusion—and the pain it
            causes
            Madeleine. Hitchcock himself ironically summed up Vertigo as boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy meets girl
            again,
            boy loses girl again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the big reveal was originally in the script, Hitchcock feared that the game was given away too
            early
            and
            decided on deleting the scene in question after the first test screening. Jimmy Stewart agreed with him, an
            associate producer did not, but it was Paramount boss Barney Balaban who ultimately ordered the director to
            put
            the
            picture back the way it was. Furthermore, the Production Code Administration wanted to see the real villain
            of
            the
            movie punished for their crime—the required scene was indeed shot, with Midge listening to a radio report
            about
            the
            character's destiny, but the director managed to keep the ending he initially intended. Vertigo is,
            therefore,
            his
            only film where the culprit gets away with it.
        </p>
        <div class="full-width-image">
            <img src="images/vertigo_6.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p class="big-letter">
            Vertigo is also the first film ever to feature the trademark shot that captures Scottie's acrophobia, which
            became
            known as <q>the Vertigo effect. As Hitchcock stated in Hitchcock by François Truffaut: </q>The viewpoint
            must be
            fixed,
            you see, while the perspective is changed as it stretches lengthwise. I thought about the problem for
            fifteen
            years.
            By the time we got to Vertigo, we solved it by using the dolly and zoom simultaneously. I asked how much it
            would
            cost, and they told me it would cost fifty thousand dollars. When I asked why, they said, 'Because to put
            the
            camera
            at the top of the stairs we have to have a big apparatus to lift it, counterweight it, and hold it up in
            space.'
            I
            said, 'There are no characters in this scene; it's simply a viewpoint. Why can't we make a miniature of the
            stairway
            and lay it on its side, then take our shot by pulling away from it? We can use a tracking shot and a zoom
            flat
            on
            the ground.' So that's the way we did it, and it only cost us nineteen thousand dollars. Hitchcock later on
            used
            this technique in his 1964 movie Marnie. Other filmmakers paid homage to the director by using the Vertigo
            effect,
            such as Steven Spielberg in Jaws, E.T. and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Movies like La Haine, The
            Lord of
            the
            Rings Trilogy, Goodfellas and The Lion King have also featured this effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            It truly is fascinating to watch Vertigo unfold, for the first third of the film presents us with what seems
            like a
            ghost story about possession that dabbles in the subject of ancestral trauma. It plays with the notion that
            sensitive individuals of future generations are, in fact, capable of acting out unresolved trauma belonging
            to
            their
            late family members by repeating their patterns over and over again, implying that the ancestor's pain was
            too
            grand
            to be tied to the time and space it initially belonged to. This narrative is meant to excite us, thrill us
            and
            unsettle us, as we follow Scottie who tries as hard as he can to <q>think</q> the problem away, but gets
            drawn
            into
            it
            deeper than he could have possibly imagined and ultimately ends up repeating a destructive pattern of his
            own.
            No
            (supernatural) possession needed, only obsession. And yet it is his obsession that ultimately makes him act
            as
            if he
            were possessed. Scottie's medical condition, although factual in and of itself, envelops the movie as both
            an
            atmosphere and a feeling state, one that we as viewers go through alongside the protagonist, constantly
            grasping
            at
            straws, incapable of being at ease, feeling as if the world is crumbling beneath our very feet. And as we
            look
            down,
            we are rendered unable to do anything about it.

            HITCHCOCK BY TRUFFAUT
        </h2>
        <p class="big-letter">
            In the fall of 1962, whilst The Birds was in post-production, François Truffaut carried out extensive
            interviews
            with Alfred Hitchcock at his offices at Universal Studios. The interviews were recorded to audio tape and
            the
            content eventually edited down into the 'Hitchcock/Truffaut' book. Buy 'Hitchcock by François Truffaut' from
            Amazon.
            Hitchcock/Truffaut documentary explores the art and influence of Hitchcock through his famed 1962 interview
            with
            François Truffaut. Available on HBO NOW and HBO GO.

            Vertigo is taken from the Boileau Narcejac novel D'Entre les Morts, which was especially written so that
            you
            might
            do a screen version of it.
            No, it wasn't. The novel was out before we acquired the rights to the property.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just the same, that book was especially written for you.
            Do you really think so? What if I hadn't bought it?
        </p>
        <p>
            In that case it would have been bought by some French director, on account of the suc­cess of Diabolique. As
            a
            matter of fact, Boileau and Narcejac did four or five novels on that the­ory. When they found out that you
            had
            been
            interested in acquiring the rights to Diabolique, they went to work and wrote D'Entre les Morts, which
            Paramount
            bought for you. Can you tell me what it was about this book that specially appealed to you?
            I was intrigued by the hero's attempts to re-create the image of a dead woman through another one who's
            alive.
            As
            you know, the story is divided into two parts. The first part goes up to Madeleine's death, when she falls
            from
            the
            steeple, and the second part opens with the hero's meeting with Judy, a brunette who looks just like
            adeleine.
            In
            the book it's at the beginning of that second part that the hero meets Judy and tries to get her to look
            like
            Madeleine, and it's only at the very end that both he and the reader discover that Ma­deleine and Judy are
            one
            and
            the same girl. That's the final surprise twist. In the screenplay we used a different approach. At the
            beginning
            of
            the second part, when Stewart meets the brunette, the truth about Judy's identity is disclosed, but only to
            the
            viewer. Though Stewart isn't aware of it yet, the viewers already know that Judy isn't just a girl who looks
            like
            Madeleine, but that she is Madeleine! Everyone around me was against this change; they all felt that the
            revelation
            should be saved for the end of the picture. I put myself in the place of a child whose mother is telling him
            a
            story. When there's a pause in her narration, the child always says, <q>What comes next, Mommy?</q> Well,
            I felt
            that
            the
            second part of the novel was written as if nothing came next, whereas in my formula, the little boy, knowing
            that
            Madeleine and Judy are the same person, would then ask, And Stewart doesn't know it, does he? What will he
            do
            when
            he finds out about it? In other words, we're back to our usual alternatives: Do we want suspense or
            surprise? We
            followed the book up to a certain point. At first Stewart thinks Judy may be Madeleine; then he resigns
            himself
            to
            the fact that she isn't, on condition that Judy will agree to resemble Madeleine in every respect. But now
            we
            give
            the public the truth about the hoax so that our suspense will hinge around the question of how Stewart is
            going
            to
            react when he discovers that Judy and Madeleine are actually the same person. That's the main line of
            thought.
            But
            there's an additional point of interest in the screenplay. You will remember that Judy resisted the idea of
            being
            made to look like Madeleine. In the book she was simply reluctant to change her appearance, with no
            justification
            for her attitude. Whereas in the film, the girl's reason for fighting off the changes is that she would
            eventually
            be unmasked. So much for the plot. To put it plainly, the man wants to go to bed with a woman who's dead; he
            is
            indulging in a form of necrophilia.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those scenes in which James Stewart takes Judy to the dress shop to buy a suit just like the one Madeleine
            wore,
            and
            the way in which he makes her tryon shoes, are among the best. He's like a maniac.
            That's the basic situation in this picture. Cinematically, all of Stewart's efforts to recreate the dead
            woman
            are
            shown in such a way that he seems to be trying to undress her, instead of the other way around. What I liked
            best is
            when the girl came back after having had her hair dyed blond. James Stewart is disappointed because she
            hasn't
            put
            her hair up in a bun. What this really means is that the girl has almost stripped, but she still won't take
            her
            knickers off. When he insists, she says, <q>All right!</q> and goes into the bathroom while he waits
            outside.
            What
            Stewart is really waiting for is for the woman to emerge totally naked this time, and ready for love.
        </p>
        <p>
            That didn't occur to me, but the close-up on Stewart's face as he's waiting for her to come out of the
            bathroom
            is
            wonderful; he's almost got tears in his eyes.
            At the beginning of the picture, when James Stewart follows Madeleine to the cemetery, we gave her a
            dreamlike,
            mysterious quality by shooting through a fog filter. That gave us a green effect, like fog over the bright
            sunshine.
            Then, later on, when Stewart first meets Judy, I decided to make her live at the Empire Hotel in Post Street
            because
            it has a green neon sign flashing continually outside the window. So when the girl emerges from the
            bathroom,
            that
            green light gives her the same subtle, ghostlike quality. After focusing on Stewart, who's staring at her,
            we go
            back to the girl, but now we slip that soft effect away to indicate that Stewart's come back to reality.
            Temporarily
            dazed by the vision of his beloved Madeleine come back from the dead, Stewart comes to his senses when he
            spots
            the
            locket. In a flash he realizes that Judy's been tricking him right along.

        <p>
            The whole erotic aspect of the picture is fascinating. I remember another scene, at the beginning, when
            Stewart
            hauled Kim Novak out of the water. He takes her to his place, where we find her asleep in his bed. As she
            gradually
            comes to, there's an implication, though it's not specifically stated, that he's probably taken the girl's
            clothes
            off and has seen her in the nude. The rest of that scene is superb, as Kim Novak walks around with her toes
            sticking
            out of his bathrobe and then settles down by the fire, with Stewart pacing back and forth behind her.
            Vertigo
            unfolds at a deliberate pace, with a contemplative rhythm that contrasts sharply with your other pictures,
            which
            are
            mostly based on swift motion and sudden transitions.
            That's perfectly natural since we're telling the story from the viewpoint of a man who's in an emotional
            crisis.
            Did
            you notice the distortion when Stewart looks down the tower stairway? Do you know how we did that?
        </p>
        <p>
            Wasn't that a track-out combined with a forward zoom?
            That's it. When Joan Fontaine fainted at the inquest in Rebecca, I wanted to show how she felt that
            everything
            was
            moving far away from her before she toppled over. I always remember one night at the Chelsea Arts Ball at
            Albert
            Hall in London when I got terribly drunk and I had the sensation that everything was going far away from me.
            I
            tried
            to get that into Rebecca, but they couldn't do it. The viewpoint must be fixed, you see, while the
            perspective
            is
            changed as it stretches lengthwise. I thought about the problem for fifteen years. By the time we got to
            Vertigo, we
            solved it by using the dolly and zoom simultaneously. I asked how much it would cost, and they told me it
            would
            cost
            fifty thousand dollars. When I asked why, they said, Because to put the camera at the top of the stairs we
            have
            to
            have a big apparatus to lift it, counterweight it, and hold it up in space.<q> I said, </q>There are no
            characters in
            this scene; it's simply a viewpoint. Why can't we make a miniature of the stairway and lay it on its side,
            then
            take
            our shot by pulling away from it? We can use a tracking shot and a zoom flat on the ground. So that's the
            way
            we
            did it, and it only cost us nineteen thousand dollars.
        </p>
        <p>
            As much as that? I feel that you really like Vertigo.
            I suppose so. One of our whimsies when a picture isn't doing too well is to blame it on the faulty
            exploitation.
            So
            let's live up to the tradition and say they just didn't handle the sales properly! Do you know that I had
            Vera
            Miles
            in mind for Vertigo, and we had done the whole wardrobe and the final tests with her?
        </p>
        <p>
            Didn't Paramount want her?
            Paramount was perfectly willing to have her, but she became pregnant just before the part that was going to
            turn
            her
            into a star. After that I lost interest; I couldn't get the rhythm going with her again.
        </p>
        <p>
            I take it, from some of your interviews, that you weren't too happy with Kim Novak, but I thought she was
            perfect
            for the picture. There was a passive, animal quality about her that was exactly right for the part.
            Miss Novak arrived on the set with all sorts of preconceived notions that I couldn't possibly go along with.
            You
            know, I don't like to argue with a performer on the set; there's no reason to bring the electricians in on
            our
            troubles. I went to Kim Novak's dressing room and told her about the dresses and hairdos that I had been
            planning
            for several months. I also explained that the story was of less importance to me than the overall visual
            impact
            on
            the screen, once the picture is completed.
        </p>
        <p>
            It seems to me these unpleasant formalities make you unfair in assessing the whole picture. I can assure you
            that
            those who admire Vertigo like Kim Novak in it. Very few American actresses are quite as carnal on the
            screen.
            When
            you see Judy walking on the street, the tawny hair and make-up convey an animal-like sensuality. That
            quality is
            accentuated, I suppose, by the fact that she wears no brassiere.
            That's right, she doesn't wear a brassiere. As a matter of fact, she's particularly proud of that!

            Samuel Taylor wrote to me agreeing that Hitchcock liked the town but only knew 'what he saw from hotels or
            restaurants or out of the limo window'. He was 'what you might call a seden­tary person'. But he still
            decided
            to
            use the Dolores Mission and, strangely, to make the house on Lombard Street Scottie's home 'because of the
            red
            door'. Taylor was in love with his city (Alex Coppel, the first writer, was 'a trans­planted Englishman')
            and
            put
            all his love into the script; and perhaps even more than that, if I am to believe a rather cryptic phrase at
            the
            end
            of his letter: 'I rewrote the script at the same time that I explored San Francisco and recaptured my past…
            'Words
            which could apply as much to the characters as to the authors and which afford us another interpretation,
            like
            an
            added flat to a key, of the direction given by Elster to Scottie at the start of the film, when he's
            describing
            Madeleine's wanderings; the pillars Scottie gazes at for so long on the other side of Lloyd Lake—the Portals
            of
            the
            Past. This personal note would explain many things: the amour fou, the dream signs, all the things that make
            Vertigo
            a film which is both typically and untypically Hitchcockian in relation to the rest of his work, the work of
            a
            perfect cynic. Cynical to the point of adding for television—an anxiously moral medium, as we all know ­a
            new
            ending
            to the film: Scottie reunited with Midge and the radio reporting Elster's arrest. Crime doesn't pay. —Chris

        <p>
            <q>Of course, I enjoyed designing the church tower and steps leading up to the bell tower. You know you
                could
                never
                get Hitch to go and look at a set, and the bell tower was completed. So I asked Herbie Coleman [the
                associate
                producer] to bring Hitch over. Herbie asked Hitch to come over, and Hitch said, 'Isn't Bummy a
                professional?
                So
                why
                do I have to go look at it?' Some mornings I was rather nervous because you would be waiting for Hitch
                to
                arrive
                and
                look at the set. All the driving scenes, for instance, we did in the studio with rear projection. You
                know
                how
                most
                directors now hate rear projection and want to be in a real car hanging on to the sides! But Bob Burks
                was
                such
                a
                good cinematographer that he really knew how to make those plates for the process shots. I always work
                carefully
                with a cameraman, the set dresser, and with the costume designer, Edith Head. I did about thirty films
                with
                her.</q>
