        <h4 class="bold">By Sven Mikulec</h4>
        <p class="big-letter">
            Working in the film business all the way since the forties, when he started out writing screenplays and
            soon
            apprenticing for the great
            Roberto Rossellini, Federico Fellini achieved a major international breakthrough with his 1960 Palme
            d'Or
            winner
            La
            Dolce Vita, a
            brilliant study of the contemporary Roman social elite and the celebrity culture as a whole. What
            followed
            was
            the
            troublesome,
            paralyzing experience of trying to find an answer to that crucial question familiar to all artists who
            manage to
            achieve their
            breakthrough and gain much-craved recognition: what next? He was on top of the world. After this
            enormous
            success,
            Fellini felt he
            needed to make a far more personal film, to turn his gaze from his surroundings to himself, but couldn't
            quite
            decide what the next
            project should be about. It was actually as early as autumn 1960 that the filmmaker started developing
            the
            idea
            for
            his new feature,
            an idea of a man struggling to deal with his problems and move on with his life, first and foremost a
            comical
            story
            of a person trying
            to come to terms with the banality of his life and the obstacles in his profession. Fellini couldn't
            figure
            out
            who
            this man was
            supposed to be, toying with the idea of making his hero a disillusioned writer or theatrical impresario.
            He
            finally
            settled on making
            him a filmmaker, slightly reluctant as he was aware what kind of parallels the audience and the critics
            were
            bound
            to draw. The
            obviously autobiographical and highly personal result of these musings was 8 1/2, an intriguing, honest,
            intellectually stimulating
            comedy drama which is now considered one of the landmarks of the 20th-century cinema. Fellini not only
            succeeded
            in
            not
            disappointing the audience whose attention he got thanks to La Dolce Vita, but created probably the best
            and
            most
            intimate film on
            the subject of filmmaking ever made. The connection between the film's protagonist, a filmmaker called
            Guido
            Anselmi, who is
            unsure of what to do with a science-fiction epic he had prepared to make, and Fellini himself was more
            than
            obvious
            even to the least
            perceptive viewers, just like it's safe to assume Guido's anxiety, insecurities and struggles with
            inspiration
            were
            Fellini's own. When I
            said I didn't even know what the plot was, journalists thought I was telling one of my habitual lies,”
            explained
            Fellini later. Instead,
            for me, it was the truth.Fellini sorted his next film out in his head, set it up, but then couldn't go
            on
            making
            it because he couldn't
            remember the story anymore.From the torturous creative block, however, an original, self-reflexive,
            thoughtful
            movie was born.
            This <q>fantastic, enchanted ballet, a magical kaleidoscope,</q> as the filmmaker described it, was
            developed
            from
            the
            idea Fellini
            struggled with for years, but ended up written in a collaborative effort by Fellini, Ennio Flaiano,
            Tullio
            Pinelli
            and Brunello Rondi, with
            Nino Rota's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVa4slCsVEI">musical score</a> and a fantastic lead
            performance
            from
            Marcelo
            Mastroianni as
            the troubled artist.
        </p>
        <p class="big-letter">
            Although initially considering to call it La bella confusione (The Beautiful Confusion) on co-writer
            Flaiano's
            suggestion, Fellini finally
            landed on 8 1/2, as he felt it was more appropriate keeping in mind the autobiographical aspect of the
            film.
            By
            the
            time he started
            making it, Fellini had already made six feature films, two short films and shared one directorial credit
            with
            Alberto Lattuada, which
            was altogether, according to Fellini's peculiar counting, seven and a half pictures. The chosen title
            further
            advocates the thesis the
            picture was the most personal one a filmmaker can really make. The brilliant part of 8 1/2 is not just
            that
            it's
            a
            touching and
            passionate exploration of filmmaking in general, but that the movie deals with its own creation, as
            Guido
            Anselmi
            conducts screen tests for roles in the very film he's a part of, just like Fellini's camera placement
            helps
            stress
            the
            inseparability of the portrayed
            filmmaker and the filmmaker creating the portrait. Enchanting, sometimes a bit befuddling but in the
            best
            way
            possible, the film is an
            intoxicating dance between reality and imagination, carried by Mastroianni with the help of the
            wonderful
            Anouk
            Aimée, Sandra Milo
            and Claudia Cardinale, with confident and imaginative camera movements handled by Fellini and
            <a href="http://www.cinematographers.nl/GreatDoPh/di%20venanzo.htm">cinematographer</a> Gianni di Venanzo,
            whose work
            with
            Michelangelo
            Antonioni, Francesco Rosi and Fellini made him one of the leading European masters of the camera of the
            middle
            part
            of the century.
        </p>
        <p class="big-letter">
            Fellini's film was shown out of competition at Cannes in April 1963, and in July it won the Grand Prix
            of
            the
            Third
            Moscow International
            Film Festival, where eight thousand people attended the screening. Its
            <a href="https://cinefiles.bampfa.berkeley.edu/cinefiles/FilmDetail?filmId=pfafilm24275">deserved
                recognition</a>
            also came from across the Atlantic, as 8 1/2 received Academy Awards in
            the
            Best
            Foreign Film and Best
            Costume Design categories, with additional nominations for the director, screenplay and art direction.
            The
            critics
            loved it, and still
            continue to show their appreciation of Fellini's vision, execution and the bravery needed to bare his
            soul
            like
            this. It's no surprise that
            some of the fiercest advocates of 8 1/2 come from the filmmaking sphere. The great Guillermo del Toro,
            for
            instance,
            stated he felt
            the film <q>speaks as much about life as it does about art,</q> calling it a lustful, sweaty, gluttonous
            poem to
            cinema.When it comes
            from the mouth of one of the most original authors of today's cinema, it carries a certain weight, but
            del
            Toro's
            appraisal is just the
            tip of the iceberg. 8 1/2 is an introspective, daring masterpiece conducted by a true, irreplaceable
            maestro.

            While in Rome, Studs Terkel interviews Federico Fellini on the set of his film 8 1/2. The director gives
            insight
            into his works, his credo,
            and his faith in man. Terkel probes into the recurring theme of all his films and delves into Fellini's
            creation
            of
            the character of Steiner
            from La Dolce Vita. Along with this interview, excerpts from conversations with the following people are
            included:
            Italian actor
            Marcello Mastroianni, French actor Alain Cuny, the writer Nelson Algren, and Fellini's associate Mario
            Del
            Vecchio.
            All provide their
            interpretations as to why the character of Steiner did what he did in La Dolce Vita. —

        <p class="bold question">
            Look, Signor Fellini, the respectable lawyer might recognize himself in Guido all right, but the fact
            remains
            that
            Guido is
            Fellini. Come on, it's like a last will and testament, that movie, a final reckoning—leaving aside the
            fact
            that
            making a final
            reckoning of one's life at the age of forty-three seems to me to be rather too early.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Why? Better to make it early than late, when there's no longer time to change anything. At forty-three
            it's
            not
            a
            bit too soon to make
            a reckoning of one's own life. That's exactly why the movie did me so much good. I feel somehow
            liberated
            now,
            and
            with a great
            urge to work. The movie—8 1/2—is like my last will and testament, you're right, and yet I don't feel
            drained. On
            the
            contrary, it
            enriched me. If it were up to me. I'd start making another tomorrow morning. Honestly. And of course if
            they
            say.
            How clever. Fellini,
            what talent.it gives me a lot of pleasure. But it isn't compliments I'm looking for with 8 1/2. I
            want… I
            want
            this feeling of liberation
            to communicate itself to anyone who goes to see it. so that after seeing it people should feel more
            free,
            should
            have a presentiment
            of something joyful…
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Good Lord Signor Fellini, don't try to tell me you care about the people who go to see your movie. If
            there's a
            man
            who couldn't care less about his neighbor and is devoid of evangelical spirit, it's you. Let's drop it,
            for
            goodness'
            sake, and
            concentrate on the important admission: the reckoning you make in 8 1/2 is a reckoning of your own life
            and
            not
            of
            some
            imaginary person.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Ugh, what a little pest. What do you want me to say. So many things… of course… are true. What happens
            in
            the
            movie
            has happened
            to me to a certain extent… There was a moment when I no longer knew what to do, could no longer remember
            a
            thing. I
            would work
            with Flajano, Pinelli, Rondi, without any conviction. I had the Saraghina episode, the one about the
            cardinal.
            But
            they were isolated
            things, floating in the void, and I could no longer remember a thing, honestly. The production team used
            to
            stand
            there, looking at
            me with imploring, suspicious eyes, and I had a strong desire to say to the producer. Let's drop it,
            let's
            forget
            about making this
            movie.'' Then it appeared to me that my bewilderment was perhaps an invitation, help from some invisible
            collaborator who was
            saying to me: Tell the truth, tell about this.'' And so I got the idea of making a movie about a
            director
            who
            wants
            to make a movie
            and can no longer remember what it is about. Yes, Guido Anselmi is only experiencing what I also partly
            experienced
            in this movie.
            And the conclusion, if you can call it a conclusion, is this: we must never strain ourselves trying to
            understand,
            but try to feel, with
            abandon. We must accept ourselves for what we are: this is what I am, and this is what I'm content to
            be. I
            want
            to
            stop building
            myths around myself, I want to see myself as I am: a liar, incoherent, hypocritical, cowardly… I want to
            have
            done
            with making
            problems out of life: I want to put myself in a position where I can love life, where I can love
            everything.
            I'm
            still talking about Guido,
            of course… And after all Saint Augustine said the same thing, Love, and do what you want.'' Well, he
            didn't
            put
            it
            like that exactly, but
            more or less…

            Fellini discusses his views of making motion pictures and his unorthodox procedures. He seeks
            inspiration in
            various
            out of the way

            the
            Appian Way, to a

            Federico Fellini originally intended for 8 1/2 to end with a surreal sequence in a train car-sets were
            built
            and
            footage was shot, but all
            that remains are still photographs. From this starting point, Mario Sesti's fifty-two-minute documentary
            details
            the
            story of that
            original ending and how it came to be replaced.

            A look at Fellini's creative process. In extensive interviews, Fellini talks a bit about his background
            and
            then
            discusses how he works
            and how he creates. Several actors, a producer, a writer, and a production manager talk about working
            with
            Fellini.
            Archive footage of
            Fellini and others on the set plus clips from his films provide commentary and illustration for the
            points
            interviewees make. Fellini is
            fully in charge; actors call themselves puppets. He dismisses improvisation and calls for
            availability.”
            His
            sets
            and his films create
            images that look like reality but are not; we see the differences and the results.

                href=https://www.dropbox.com/s/aq7g3nnlk8gan2j/Marcello%20Mastroianni%20by%20Playboy%201965.pdf?raw=1>interview</a>
            with
            Marcello
            Mastroianni during the early days of the cultural revolution.
        </p>
        <p>
            For 35 of his 40 years, Marcello Mastroianni was a name virtually unknown (and certainly unpronounced)
            outside
            of
            Italy, where he
            had earned something of a reputation as a promising actor on the Roman stage, and as a competent, if
            unsensational,
            second
            lead in third-rate Italian movies. Then, in 1960, filmmaker Federico Fellini decided that Mastroianni's
            rather
            dissipated good looks
            and worldly ways would be perfect for the part of a sensitive but weak-willed Roman journalist who ends
            up a
            member
            of the
            decadent café society he sets out to sensationalize in print. Fellini was right. The picture was La
            Dolce
            Vita,
            and
            it made
            Mastroianni, in his 45th film, a major matinee idol almost overnight. Though still tongue-twistingly
            yclept
            (Mar-chello Mah-stroyah-nee), he has since gone onward and upward, in a succession of versatile
            variations
            on
            the
            laconic-Latin-lover role, to become
            one of international filmdom's reigning male sex symbols, and to set a singular new style in movie
            stars—the
            nonheroic hero, a
            kind of modern intellectual Everyman. Consummately portraying such tortured contemporary types as a
            world-weary
            author (in La
            Notte), a cuckolded husband (in Divorce—Italian Style) and a cynical, soul-searching movie director (in
            8
            1/2),
            he
            has come to
            epitomize for many <q>the plight of modern man himself,</q> in the words of one critic, loveless,
            faithless,
            rudderless,
            spiritually
            anesthetized and immobilized, whirled along in the swift and shifting crosscurrents and powerless to
            influence
            or
            arrest the order
            of events; incapable either of disciplining his desires or of satisfying his needs, let alone those of
            his
            fellow
            man.Despite—or
            perhaps because of—his ambivalent image of inward impotence and predatory potency, Mastroianni exudes a
            charismatic
            magnetism that seems to bring out the maternal, as well as the mating, instinct in a vast international
            following of
            female fans
            who see him as both son and lover; both as a helpless, all-too-human little boy and as a suave,
            self-assured
            man
            of
            the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not surprisingly, in view of the remarkable verisimilitude with which he manages to invest his movie
            roles,
            the
            resemblance
            between the real-life Mastroianni and his reel-life counterpart is far more than skin-deep. It was in
            the
            hope
            of
            illuminating both
            that we called on the actor at his home in Rome with our request for an exclusive interview. Having
            heard
            that
            he is
            far from fond
            of being buttonholed by journalists, we were prepared for the unconcealed disinclination he displayed at
            first.
            Why
            should your
            readers care what Mastroianni thinks?he asked. We assured him that they would; but he was still
            evasive
            and
            noncommittal.
            After a few more days of telephonic pursuit, however, he finally consented to see us on the set of his
            new
            picture,
            Casanova 70 (in
            which he plays a latter-day Lothario afflicted with impotence which he can overcome only by staging his
            seductions
            where there's
            an imminent danger of discovery). We began our conversations on the spot, speaking in Italian. After an
            hour, we
            were just
            getting warmed up, so our talks continued on and off for the next week—on the set; in his downtown
            apartment,
            where
            we met
            his wife of 15 years and their teenage daughter; at his lavish new home, still under construction, on
            the
            outskirts
            of the city, where
            we sat on the lawn amid a clutter of statuary and antique mosaics which he couldn't decide where to put;
            and
            on
            a
            meandering
            stroll down the cobbled side streets of old Rome, with periodic stop-offs for espresso, and a plate of
            pasta
            at
            the
            Cafe Rosati, a
            venerable artists' and writers' hangout on the Piazza del Popolo.
        </p>
        <p>
            We found him to be a fascinating subject: urbane, ironic, articulate, introspective, insightful,
            outwardly
            serene
            but charged with a
            banked intensity, seemingly suffused with ennui yet somehow still boyishly disarming. Like the
            characters he
            so
            often plays, he is a
            complex, enigmatic and paradoxical man.

        <p class="bold question">
            For four years you've been considered the biggest and best male star in Europe, and a major box-office
            attraction
            around
            the world. How do you account for your change of fortune, after more than a decade in minor roles?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            I was lucky enough to get a film that had a meaning to me personally—Fellini's La Dolce Vita. The public
            also
            liked
            it, which
            naturally pleased me. But I was concerned first with myself. I looked in the mirror one morning and
            said:
            You
            have
            only so many
            good years left. From now on out, you do only parts that involve you personally, that have meaning in
            your
            life
            and
            the lives of the
            people around you.Since then it's been a boom.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            When you speak of personal involvement in your parts, do you mean that they're autobiographical in a
            sense,
            that
            you're
            actually like the characters you played in La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Yes. I did those two Fellini films not as an actor but as a man. I took part because I needed, as a man,
            to
            realize
            myself through
            them. They are the best mirror of my real self. It's not that I play myself, actually, but rather more
            that
            I am
            looking for myself in
            the roles. There is this synthesis between the roles and the real me—as if I'm trying myself out in
            them.
            Who
            knows
            which one is
            more authentic? Each one seems so at the time.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            All the films you've made, in one way or another, are about weak men—psychologically, socially and often
            sexually
            impotent. Is that you?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Yes and no. It's part of me; and I think it's part of many other men today. Modern man is not as virile
            as
            he
            used
            to be. Instead of
            making things happen, he waits for things to happen to him. He goes with the current. Something in our
            society
            has
            led him to
            stop fighting, to cease swimming upstream.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            What is that something?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Doubt, for one thing. Doubt about his place in society, his purpose in life. In my country, for example,
            I
            was
            brought up with the
            thought of man as the padrone, the pillar of the family. I wanted to be a loving, caring, protective
            man.
            But
            now I
            feel lost; the
            sensitive man everywhere feels lost. He is no longer padrone—either of his own world or of his women.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Why not?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Because women are changing into men, and men are becoming women. At least, men are getting weaker all
            the
            time.
            But
            much
            of this is man's own fault. We shouted, <q>Women are equal to men; long live the Constitution!</q> But
            look
            what
            happened. The
            working woman emerged—angry, aggressive, uncertain of her femininity. And she multiplied—almost by
            herself.
            Matriarchy, in
            the home and in the factory and in business, has made women into sexless monsters and piled them up on
            psychiatric
            couches.
            Instead of finding themselves, they lost what they had. But some see this now and are trying to change
            back.
            Women
            in England,
            for example, who were the first to raise the standard of equality, are today in retreat.

        <p class="bold question">
            How about American women?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            They should retreat, but they don't. I've never seen so many unhappy, melancholy women. They have
            liberty—but
            they
            are
            desperate. Poor darlings, they're so hungry for romance that two little words in their ears are enough
            to
            crumble
            them before
            your eyes. American women are beautiful, but a little cold and too perfect—too well brought up, with the
            perfume
            and
            the hair
            always just so and the rose-colored skin. What perfection—and what a bore! Believe me, it makes you want
            to
            have
            a
            girl with a
            mustache, cross-eyes and runs in her stockings. I got to know a few of them when I was there, but I
            swear it
            was
            like knowing only
            one woman. Geraldine Page was the only exception—and an exciting one.

        <p class="bold question">
            Are Italian women different?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Thank God, yes.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            In what way?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Their smell, for one thing.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Their smell?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Yes, their body fragrance. Now, I'm not playing my role as a lover here, but I believe I'd be able to
            tell
            an
            Italian woman from any
            other woman, even in the dark, just by her natural fragrance. It's a sort of homespun odor. I love it.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Apart from her fragrance, how is she different from American women?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            She's not afraid to be a woman—not yet, anyway. But what happened to women in America is beginning to
            take
            place
            in
            Italy, too,
            and I don't like it. I don't feel tenderness toward this new kind of women. I wouldn't even want to have
            children by
            them. I want
            women to have all the faults and weaknesses they always had. I adore them, but we must keep them in
            their
            place.
            It's
            presumptuous for a woman to show me she is a doctor of mathematics. Comptometers can do that. What's
            more
            subtle
            and
            difficult is to know how to make a man feel important.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            You don't think women have the right to a career, to compete with men in the professional world?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Of course, they must evolve—but not away from being women. At the same time, I admit we have to do
            something
            with
            them
            besides give them babies. In Italy, women now have fewer children and do less housework than ever. This
            makes
            them
            bored and
            a terrible weight on men. Now, I like to have a woman hang on—but not to suffocate me. So today she
            needs
            some
            kind
            of
            occupation, and it's right for her to want to be on man's level. My logic admits this—but my instincts
            tell
            me
            to
            watch out. A man
            like myself fears this <q>contemporary woman.</q> She is conquering something important, and her
            evolution is
            exciting.
            But man is
            conquering nothing; indeed, he's losing his power, his virility, even his intelligence.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Are you saying this is true of all men, or just Italian men—or perhaps only yourself?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Well, so much depends on the emotional climate in which you were raised. You're American. I speak of
            myself
            and
            my
            own
            country—an old country. I remember my grandfather. He lived to be 90. I used to watch him and admire his
            authority.
            Where has
            all that gone? What's happened to that kind of man? Whatever it was that buried him, it took with it a
            whole
            era, a
            whole way of
            life. It left women doing some of the things he did; and this causes me deep anxiety. But perhaps this
            is an
            era
            in
            which we all feel
            lost—a period of transition where the only thing that keeps man going is habit. But here again, women
            have
            the
            advantage. They
            believe in love, and we men don't even believe in that anymore. Once men dueled over women, grand dukes
            fell
            at
            the
            feet of
            ballerinas and whole armies chased them. But when a man chases a woman today, we say: What luck—he can
            still
            run.”
            We seem
            to have forgotten that love can be a most extraordinary support for a man. A man in love is master of
            the
            world.
            Even though love
            costs him pain, it's a marvelous kind of suffering.

        <p class="bold question">
            Does it have to cause suffering?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Yes. And it almost always ends the same: with disenchantment. The exception is rare, rare.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Still, your friends say that you fall in love easily.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            That's true—but only on the level of fantasy. In my imagination, I work myself up to a fantastic and
            sublime
            passion
            for a woman.
            Then I go out with her. But since I've created such an extraordinary love in my mind—which isn't real
            and
            exists
            only within
            myself—I soon realize she isn't exceptional after all. Then I get tired and go looking for another one.
            You
            understand? I've always
            felt I lacked the capabilities of real, serious love. For me, it's always a game in which I pretend to
            love.
            And
            try
            to make it
            exceptional. Maybe one should love without imagining too much.
            What's ironic is that the same thing works in reverse. Say a woman meets me and finds me attractive. She
            imagines me
            to be like
            my screen image—the great lover. But I'm not a lover type, not in the conventional sense, anyway.
            There's no
            erotic
            charge in me.
            In any case, I can't assure a woman that I'll be able to give her what she wants, because what she
            wants—whatever it
            is—isn't
            really me.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Has any woman ever really understood you?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            No, never. But as I was saying, just because you're a famous movie star, women think you must be a
            passionate
            and
            tireless
            lover—especially if you're Italian. The demands are terrible. Not even a superman could meet them. I
            wish
            women
            would like me
            in that context which most resembles me. I've always tried to do screen roles that weren't for studs or
            bulls.
            You've seen the films
            I've made: Bell' Antonio, La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2. None of the protagonists is a big lover who can take a
            woman
            in
            a
            room for a night and
            make endless love, wham-bam behind a door. I think the men in my films are much more normal, even though
            they
            possess
            —what?—a certain confusion. And I've always sought roles that weren't domineering over women; I'm just
            not
            that
            type.

        <p class="bold question">
            Yet one critic has called you <q>the Clark Gable of the Sixties.</q> Do you think the title fits?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            If anything, I'm the anti-Gable. He was the type of hero who was popular yesterday. Gable and others,
            like
            Gary
            Cooper, played
            strong, clean men, full of virtue and honesty. They were decisive and solid and knew where they were
            going.
            Or
            they
            lived in a
            world which presumed that a he-man always knew where he was going. But today we don't know where we're
            going. As
            I
            explained before, the system of virtues and morals used by our fathers just doesn't work anymore. It
            ceased
            working
            some time
            ago, but now we admit it openly. We admit our weakness, or at least our confusion. As Antonioni said,
            Who's
            a
            hero
            under the
            atom bomb? Or who isn't one?So in my roles I reveal that I am simply human; this confession of the
            human
            condition
            is the
            difference between myself and Gable. In this sense, I play myself. He played a myth—a myth that was
            credible
            yesterday but I
            think not today. If Gable were to begin again with the same image, I doubt he would become King Gable.

        <p class="bold question">
            Alberto Moravia has compared you to Dino, the protagonist of his novel 'The Empty Canvas.' He says you
            both
            epitomize
            <q>the neocapitalist hero, alienated from himself and his society.</q> Do you feel this is true?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            In many ways, yes. But I don't think I'm any kind of hero, neocapitalist or otherwise. If anything, I am
            an
            antihero
            or at the most a
            nonhero. Time said I had the frightened, characteristically 20th century look, with a spine made of
            plastic
            napkin
            rings. I accepted
            this—because modern man is that way; and being a product of my time and an artist, I can represent him.
            If
            humanity
            were all
            one piece, I would be considered a weakling. I hate to keep bringing up my grandfather, but I can't help
            comparing
            myself to him.
            He was a hero to me in a way. I try to be like him, but it's no use. I have a farm at Lucca, where the
            modern
            world
            has not yet
            changed the order of things. There I put on a velour jacket like they used to wear, and the servants
            say,
            Buon
            giorno, Padrone.I
            kid myself into thinking I'm the man my grandfather was. I put on the clothes and I play. I act at being
            a
            man.
            The
            illusion gives
            me a sense of belonging to the past—which is very much more real to me than the present.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Why?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            It gives me strength—or at least an illusion of strength. I go through certain periods in my life when I
            am
            nourished mainly by
            memories. During recent years I have felt an increasing desire to go backward, to plunge myself into my
            infancy.
            Every other day I
            go to see my mother, and sometimes I even sleep in her home. It's not just seeing my mother: It's a
            drive to
            return
            to the past, as
            though a man such as myself, dedicated to remembrance of dreams, could love only two things really well:
            his
            own
            mother and his
            children—the past and the future. The present is something you flee through as quickly as possible. So
            whatever
            images I cling to,
            I'm not a hero—on or off the screen. My type just happens to have come into fashion.

            But the nonheroic hero is certainly nothing new in films, is he?
        </p>

            Isn't he?
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Wouldn't you call Charlie Chaplin a classic example of this type?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            No, because he wasn't a hero but a character comedian, even though he was a leading man. Charlot was the
            frontrunner
            of the
            nonheroes, who have since become a common tribe. We follow, without any of his genius, and not always
            laughing.
            Today the
            public prefers the noncomical nonhero, just as they prefer the imperfect beauty of some of their new
            heroines—Jeanne
            Moreau,
            for example.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Do you find her kind of beauty attractive?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Very much. Moreau is a fragile, desperate woman—but strong at the same time, because she's a real woman,
            all
            of
            her.
            She's
            stupendous also where it counts—jealous, demanding, indulgent. She lives and lets live, without
            confusing
            love
            and
            eternity. She's
            one of the few women I know who would be worth falling in love with. It doesn't matter if she doesn't
            have
            perfect
            beauty; she's
            beautiful all the same. Have you seen the bags under her eyes?
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Like yours.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Yes. Maybe there's an affinity between our two natures.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Do you find Sophia Loren equally attractive?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            No. She's also very much a woman, but she hasn't Jeanne's desperation. She has a femininity, a maternal
            sense,
            that
            is ancient in
            woman but rare to find today. She has a force one can find in one's own mother, a moral strength that
            makes
            her
            fascinating. I'd
            say Sophia is a type of woman that in a short while will no longer exist, while Jeanne is of today. I
            feel
            attracted
            to both of them—
            but in different ways.
        </p>

            To Sophia as a mother image and to Jeanne as a lover?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            To Sophia as a friend. I've taken her to my mother's home many times. She's the only actress I've been
            tied
            to
            out
            of affection for
            more than ten years. In the movie world, that's quite a long time.

            Are there any other actresses you admire?

        <p class="answer">
            Greta Garbo. I met her on a recent trip to New York. She invited me to visit her in her apartment. I
            suppose
            she
            was
            curious about
            me. She is a very sympathetic and extraordinary woman. We talked through an interpreter. The only thing
            I
            understood
            directly
            was when she looked at my shoes and said: <q>Ah, Italian shoes—beautiful.</q> I was very embarrassed,
            because
            they
            were
            English, not
            Italian. But to make her happy I said Yes.”
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            What else did you talk about?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Our conversation was broken off by a harebrained American woman who said to Garbo, I saw you in films.
            How
            beautiful you
            were in your epoch.This made Garbo so angry that she got up and left. She was right to do it. That
            woman
            should
            never have
            said that. If she didn't understand that much about Garbo, she was stupid. An hour later Garbo phoned me
            at
            a
            cocktail party to
            say she was sorry to have left that way, and that she liked meeting me. I understand her. She feels very
            alone,
            and
            all her life she's
            been afraid of people and crowds.

            been
            a
            few hysterical mobs,

        <p class="bold question">
            Isn't public recognition one of the reasons you became an actor?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Not that kind of recognition. Not even applause, or the praise of my peers. No, I became an actor
            because it
            exalted
            me, even as a
            child. There is no joy quite so fulfilling, so exhilarating as the extraordinary emotion one feels when
            performing.
            It's equal to the
            thrill you get with a woman. Nothing else can compare with it. Normally—and I think most actors are like
            this—I
            don't feel
            complete except when acting. After it's over, I'm incomplete again. Not working is terrible. But at the
            moment
            when
            they cry
            <q>Action!</q> everything you've thought about, everything you've tried to foresee, suddenly—in a
            flash—comes
            together
            like an
            electric spark. Zzzst! It's the act of creation, when all the elements are fused.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Would you call yourself an instinctive actor?

        <p class="answer">
            I often say I am, because it amuses me; it's convenient to say it; otherwise people want to know what
            system”
            you
            use, how you
            think, and your reasons. Since all that annoys the hell out of me, I say I'm <q>an instinctive actor.</q>
            But
            I
            tell
            you
            as a friend, it's not
            so. It can't be so. I have to foresee, to plan everything, big and little.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Fellini has said that you have <q>a supercharge of animal heat</q> that invests your roles with life even
            before
            you
            speak.
            Wasn't he talking about your acting instinct?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Sure. But what sort of animal does he mean? An actor isn't a trained horse that goes into its act,
            because a
            horse
            can't act. The
            personage must mature within you. But not by study. I don't study a damn thing. It's my subconscious
            that
            does
            the
            work. Once
            I've read the script, and once I've isolated the character—which I always seek to resemble me
            somewhat—it
            begins
            to
            grow within
            me during the day, no matter what I do—like a parasite. So little by little I assimilate it—or vice
            versa.
            It
            comes
            through the
            instinct, yes, because this is inevitable. But not through study. Take an example: If I have to play the
            part of
            a
            madman, I don't go
            to an insane asylum to study madmen. This doesn't accomplish anything; it will lead to a mere imitation.
            If
            your
            character in the
            script is written well and involved in real situations, the madness of the role will come out by itself.
            It
            will
            mature within you,
            animating your voice and your body of its own volition.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            That sounds like the Method.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            I don't know anything about methods or systems or schools. But you must make sense of all the elements
            that
            motivate
            the mind
            of a character. You must select the best in order to better reach the public, calculating and using the
            effect.
            When
            I prepare for a
            scene, I reflect much on what I have to do. Much. I study the gestures and facial expressions,
            everything.
            This
            is a
            technical job, not
            instinctive, and it's something an actor must do. Similarly, a painter doesn't work by instinct alone;
            he
            calculates
            his colors before
            freeing himself into creative action. An artist, like an actor, must meditate deeply what he
            does—perhaps
            leaning
            more on instinct
            than on culture. That's the main point. I'm not a cultured actor. I'm more instinctive than cultured.
            When
            the
            chucker goes
            <q>chock,</q> I let myself go, and from there—bzzzt!—I'm off. Then something unforeseen happens, some
            small
            thing
            that
            gives you the slightest shudder. Something new and unexpected occurs; it's that which gives you a sense
            of
            creation.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Do these unforeseen occurrences include taking liberties with the script?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Well, I shouldn't say this, but I never study the lines I recite. I read the script two or three times,
            think
            about
            it a little, then I throw
            it away and can never find it again. Then, at the last minute, I say to the assistant director: What's
            my
            line?”
            The exact words are
            not important; that's a mechanical element. I never say the exact dialog. Often I change the words. I
            like
            to
            abandon myself to the
            part; if the character has matured sufficiently within me, the words come out by themselves. So there's
            a
            kind
            of
            truth harnessed
            at the last moment, as it once was in the commedia dell' arte, when the actors improvised their lines on
            the
            stage.

        <p class="bold question">
            You began your own career as a stage actor; but you haven't done a play in nine years. Why not?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Lack of good plays. Where is the avant-garde theater in Italy? Osborne, Ionesco, Miller—always the same.
            Actually,
            Miller asked
            me to do After the Fall. When it didn't come off, I wasn't upset. I'd already played the role—and
            better,
            too—in
            8
            1/2.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            You feel that Guido, the director in Fellini's 8 1/2, is the same role as Miller's Quentin—only better?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Don't you think it has more humanity—that it's more universal? I do. Also, Guido says more about the
            loneliness
            of
            the
            intellectual, his incapacity to love and communicate with others, and the resultant aridity that's the
            terrible
            burden of our lives
            today.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Do you feel, then, that 8 1/2 is a work superior to After the Fall?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Much superior. Not only because of content, but also because it's in cinema. If you know what you're
            doing,
            if
            you
            have means
            and the talent, films can be invested with more humanity than theater. They can reach deeper into human
            beings.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            But as a performer, don't you miss the applause of a live theater audience?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            No, why should I? Does a painter need immediate applause? Isn't eventual acclaim enough? Besides, after
            creating
            a
            role, you
            want to do something else—not the same thing night after night. An actor needs to renew himself. But I
            don't
            mean
            I'm
            antitheater. In fact, I am going to do a musical shortly in Rome, on the life of Rudolph Valentino.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Can you sing?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            I'm going to try—even though they say I'm tone deaf. What does it matter? I want to have some fun. Also,
            I
            like
            the
            prospect of
            finding new dimensions in the personality of Valentino. Let's see if there isn't more to him than the
            myth
            of
            the
            great lover. The
            success of a type like Valentino or Marilyn Monroe is inevitably dramatic, tragic, grotesque—because the
            private
            lives of these
            people are almost always impoverished. Imagine the effort it must have taken for Valentino to convince
            himself
            that
            he was really
            like his myth—or, even worse, not like his myth. I'm sure he made very little love. That makes you
            laugh? It
            makes
            me cry.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Will your portrayal of Valentino be as self-exploratory as the parts you've played on the screen?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Perhaps. We'll have to wait and see.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Last year, in a dramatic change of pace after your many roles as the world-weary Latin lover, you turned
            in
            a
            remarkable
            performance as a bearded, bespectacled socialist labor leader in The Organizer. Did you see yourself in
            this
            part,
            too?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Very much so. That film was particularly dear to me. It had a profound human message, and the role of
            the
            professor
            was
            beautiful.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Are you a socialist yourself?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            I'm the son of workers. What else could I be? I'll admit I'm a rose-water socialist—that is, I'm not
            active.
            I
            don't
            belong to the party
            and I avoid involvement, because it means compromise. So I stand in the window and watch. But I vote
            socialist,
            because in our
            affluent society it seems logical that all this largesse should be spread around a little more
            equitably.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Those are generous sentiments coming from someone who is said to earn $300,000 per picture.
            Madonna mia! Is it that much?
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">

        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            If I told you, the tax collector would assume it was a lie and double it. It's terrible here. Nobody can

            They figure you're a

        <p class="bold question">
            You're also said to have received many offers of $500,000 a picture to work in Hollywood. Do you plan to
            accept
            any
            of
            them?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Maybe. I can't decide.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Why not?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            The idea of working in Hollywood troubles me. Apart from the fact that I don't understand English very
            well,
            I
            just
            don't
            understand the people there. I don't understand why someone like Marlon Brando—who is a great actor—does
            films
            like
            Mutiny
            on the Bounty. And those Westerns! Why are Americans so obsessed with Westerns? Is it a problem for
            them?
            Why
            doesn't Brando,
            who has a great talent, make films about the lives of people in New York, or Chicago, or St. Louis—and
            not
            about
            men
            on South
            Sea islands and those who live in the mythological world of the cowboy?
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Are you against escapist entertainment?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Of course not. People have always gone to movies for escape and relaxation. But they go especially if it
            also
            has a
            meaning for
            them, if it is rooted in their lives and touches on their own problems. Comedy can do this. Take
            Chaplin,
            for
            example, or Divorce
            —Italian Style. That was funny, but it dealt with a serious problem in Italy.

        </div>
        <p class=" bold question">
            What are your own feelings about divorce, Italian style—the institution, not the movie?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            It doesn't exist. The Church originally prohibited divorce with the aim of making marriage important and
            beautiful.
            Yet this has
            had the opposite effect. Adultery is rife and no one takes the marriage contract seriously, because the
            element
            of
            choice has been
            precluded. Terrible things come from it. Intolerable marriages end up in second unions out of wedlock.
            Children
            born
            from these
            grow up nameless, filled with awful complexes about their illegitimacy.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            How do you feel about the Church's stand on birth control?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            It's ridiculous, obsolete. I cannot believe that those bishops, sitting in the Vatican Council, are not
            wise
            men.
            Surely they see the
            needs of the contemporary world. The rhythm method, which the Church accepts, simply doesn't work out.
            On
            the
            <q>right</q> days
            one may not feel like making love at all. Or if a wife tells her husband she's having a forbidden”
            phase,
            he
            may
            take up with a tart
            for the night, which enrages and alienates his wife. It's the cause of countless separations.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Many movie marriages wind up on the rocks. Why has yours lasted?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            I've accepted my wife's defects and she's accepted mine. This is out of sufferance and I suppose because
            we're
            modern about it.
            It's useless to try and escape ourselves. Maybe we're not ideal together; but maybe we are. We're both
            full
            of
            defects, many
            defects. Maybe we weren't made to be together; but for this very reason it might be too easy not to stay
            together.
            So we say,
            <q>Let's stick it out all the same.</q> It's a kind of game we want to make work.

        <p class="bold question">
            Does your Catholicism have anything to do with why you remain married?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            No, I'm not a real Catholic, anyway—even though I am religious. Jesus Christ is an admirable example,
            but
            he's
            too
            remote from
            men of today to be a model. Or he's too much of one to be understood and followed. A man who dies for
            others
            is
            moving and
            admirable, but how many followers can he have in a world filled with people who will hardly help you
            across
            the
            street, let alone
            die for you?
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            How do you feel about death? Are you afraid of it?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            The thought of it does bother me a bit.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Would you like to be immortal?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Are you making an offer? If so, I'd like to remain eternally 35 or 36—mature, but still young and
            powerful,
            like
            a
            bull. The idea of
            growing old and feeble is extremely annoying. I'm also unsettled by the thought of shifting over to
            spirit
            form
            and
            floating about
            like that.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Spirit form? You believe in a life after death?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Truthfully, no. If I did, life would be more noble, more interesting, because it would have an ultimate
            goal—that of
            continuing. If I
            were a profound Catholic and believed in the afterlife of the soul, I'd be a man of greater force and
            more
            clear-minded, because
            I'd have a precise purpose to prepare myself for. But since I fear everything will end with death, I
            say,
            What
            do I
            care?Of course,
            this leads to living in a negative manner, because the end, after all, is the end. Over and out.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            You fear death; do you also fear life?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            I fear the decisions of life. Matters requiring solution frighten me, because I'm not able to do it.
            Proposals
            for
            work also frighten
            me. I've offers for films from everywhere—too many. I agree to them—but then I run off and hide. For
            example, I
            told
            you I was
            doing Rudolph Valentino for fun; and it's true. But there's another reason. By accepting this theatrical
            offer,
            I
            don't have to worry
            about the others. And so I have a modicum of peace for a small time. Especially from the Americans. When
            I
            get
            their
            fantastic
            offers, I think: What are they saying? They're crazy. I'm not that important.”
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            Still, if you
            could begin
            again, wouldn't it be as an actor?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            I'd be both an actor and an architect. I would do a film, then build a building, then a film—and so on.
            The
            Seagram's Building in
            New York took my breath away. I'd like to build one in Rome, a palazzo of glass and crystal that would
            also
            take
            people's breath
            away. Like a great sculpture. Not to make money, though. It would probably lose money. But it would be
            there
            for
            me
            to stand
            before it and say: Look, there is something I did which I love and which will last—at least a little
            longer
            than
            myself.”
