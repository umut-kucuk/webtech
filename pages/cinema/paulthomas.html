            Slowly, cautiously, vaccinated to the nines, we are returning to
            some of
            the
            basic pleasures of ordinary life. A few nights ago, my wife and
            I
            went
            to our
            local movie theatre, a multiplex with huge screens and blaring
            sound
            systems. I
            love all of it: the coming attractions for horror flicks I'll
            never
            see
            and for spy
            films I wouldn't miss; the chattering crowd; the Brobdingnagian
            snacks;
            the
            adhesive floors. Our choice for the night was Paul Thomas
            Anderson's
            <q>Licorice Pizza,</q> a film set in the San Fernando Valley of the
            nineteenseventies. It's about the strangeness of being young,
            the
            experience of becoming
            a human being and shaping a self. The fractured narrative is
            wised-up
            and sly,
            but also winningly sincere. It's been a long pandemic, and this
            was
            an
            exhilarating reminder of what joy is like.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anderson is fifty-one, and he has been making movies since he
            was an
            adolescent. He is a Valley kid, and he's never really left those
            suburban streets.
            His first features—<q>Hard Eight</q> and <q>Boogie Nights</q>—came out
            when
            he
            was
            in his mid-twenties, and, ever since, he has been the sort of
            artist
            whose new
            work is always an event. Philip Seymour Hoﬀman, Daniel
            Day-Lewis,
            Tom
            Cruise, Melora Walters, Julianne Moore, and Joaquin Phoenix are
            among
            the
            veteran actors who have appeared in his best films, which
            include
            <q>Punch-Drunk Love,</q>
            <q>Magnolia,</q>
            <q>There Will Be Blood,</q>
            <q>The Master,</q>
            and
            <q>Phantom Thread.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
            Anderson rarely speaks to reporters. I was reminded of that when
            I
            got
            on a
            Zoom call with him the day after seeing his movie. His square
            was
            not
            indicated by his name but, rather, <q>Mason & Dixon,</q> a sign of
            his
            admiration
            for the reclusive novelist Thomas Pynchon. (Anderson made a film
            of
            Pynchon's novel <q>Inherent Vice.</q>) I spoke with Anderson for The
            New
            Yorker
            Radio Hour; our conversation has been edited for length and
            clarity.
            He
            was
            speaking from his home in the Valley. And, since he has set
            <q>Boogie Nights,</q>
            <q>Magnolia,</q> and, now, <q>Licorice Pizza</q> in that territory, I
            began
            the
            conversation by asking him why the place resonates so deeply for
            him.
        </p>
        <p class="big-letter">
            I love it. It's as simple as that: it sort of begins and ends
            there.
            I
            can remember
            being a kid and thinking at a certain point, probably in my
            teen-age
            years,
            I've got to get out of here. <q>Out of here</q> being over the hill,
            not
            in
            the San
            Fernando Valley. Maybe that's L.A., maybe that's New York, maybe
            that's
            London, maybe it's Shanghai—whatever it is, I have to get out of
            here.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            But I'm one of those people who loves to get away for
            twenty-four
            hours
            and
            then I start getting itchy and thinking about home. I just want
            to
            come
            back
            home. I'm one of those homebody-type people. I'm comfortable
            here.
            My
            family's here, my friends are here. It's a place I keep
            returning
            to.
            Whatever
            ambition you have to spread your wings, I always find myself
            returning
            here.
            After London, when we were making <q>Phantom Thread</q>—it was a
            dream of
            mine to be able to work there—but when I got back home, I was
            just
            so
            thrilled. The Valley is not the prettiest place in the world,
            it's
            not
            the most
            cultured place in the world, I understand that, but it's home.
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            When I was a kid, I'd listen to late-night radio and watch
            late-night
            television, and everybody from California would make jokes about
            the
            Valley. I didn't know what that was. What was the joke? What is
            the
            Valley in
            a spiritual sense and in terms of the landscape of your youth?

            It's funny—I wonder if Johnny Carson might've contributed to
            that
            because he
            would always say, <q>Beautiful downtown Burbank!</q> It may not be
            beautiful.
            And
            there is no real downtown. . . .
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            I mean, the San Fernando Valley—what is it? It's a flat space
            between
            the
            San
            Gabriel Mountains and the Santa Monica Mountains. Its primary
            reason
            for
            existing, at one time, was farmland. And, famously, there's the
            story
            from
            <q>Chinatown</q> of how water was diverted from the Valley.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            It's a suburb. And the suburbs seemed to always come in for a
            beating.
            I'm not
            quite sure why. When I was first writing <q>Boogie Nights</q> when I
            was a
            teenager, there was a terrific story in my own back yard. I
            didn't
            have
            to go far. I
            didn't have to make things up. I could do the research, learning
            more
            about
            these people in this industry, but it was familiar to me. At
            some
            point,
            I
            probably read that I should <q>Write what you know.</q> That's a good
            place
            to
            start. This work is hard enough. So why am I struggling to try
            to
            learn
            something that's beyond my grasp or that doesn't speak to me?
        </p>
        <p class="bold question">
            <q>Licorice Pizza</q> centers on two characters. One is Gary
            Valentine,
            played by
            Cooper Hoﬀman, a teen-age guy who is incredibly charismatic for
            his
            age.
            He's a small-time actor. He starts a water-bed business and then
            a
            pinball
            palace. His patter, his bravado, is amazing for somebody fifteen
            years
            old. He
            falls for a girl, Alana Kane, played by Alana Haim. She's much
            older
            than he
            is. She's in her mid-twenties, with a thwarted life but an inner
            intelligence
            that's also magnetic. How is that rooted in your experience? If
            you're
            writing
            what you know, what's the germ of the story of <q>Licorice Pizza</q>
            for
            you?

        <p class="answer">
            I was the second of four [children], so I had an older sister
            and
            she
            had older
            friends. She is a good two, three, four years older than me. And
            a
            buddy
            of
            mine had an older sister. So, we just sort of happened to fall
            in
            the
            cracks so
            that, when we were fourteen, fifteen, these were girls that were
            around
            us—our
            sisters' friends—were eighteen, nineteen. And they had cars! So,
            every
            waking
            hour was devoted to trying to get them to drive us somewhere!
            And
            behind
            it
            was trying to flirt with them or hang out with them or get
            noticed by
            them in
            some way that was more than just being an irritating little
            brother.

        <p class="answer">
            I can remember having a couple of friendships with some of those
            girls
            who I
            met along the way. They were just friendships, but they were
            fantastic.
            They
            were fantastic just because they were just friendships, you
            know? To
            have a
            friendship with a just slightly older woman, who wasn't your
            sister—I
            had a toe
            in a version of the adult world or what started to feel adult
            just
            because of the
            transportation that they had.

        <p class="bold question">
            Maybe the greatest assertion of power and age diﬀerence in the
            movie
            is
            not
            the erotic one but the driving one. At one point, Alana is
            driving
            not a
            car
            but a truck, and she's driving it at one point backward at full
            speed
            down a
            hill, down into the center of town. [Gary is her terrified and
            thrilled
            passenger.] This is high drama. It's better than Grace Kelly
            driving
            at
            top
            speed along a mountain road in the South of France with Cary

            That sequence that you're referring to is a catchall for any
            number
            of
            episodes
            that were either that dangerous or slightly less dangerous. And
            they
            happened
            particularly in Southern California because it's such a driving
            community. We are slaves to our cars. We love them. Especially
            at that
            age—your
            whole
            life was
            dedicated to getting a car somehow. And the kind of trouble that
            you
            found
            yourself in as a result was usually vast; you look back and
            think, I
            cannot believe
            I made it out alive. So, that sequence taps into those episodes.
            At
            the
            time, you
            just think it was just hilarious fun, but with a little bit of
            distance
            you realize it
            was really life-or-death.

            production
            is by
            Ghoulardi Film Company [Anderson's production company]. This

            My father—his name is Ernie Anderson, and he was originally from
            Boston.
            After the war, he came back and was a radio d.j. in Vermont, and
            he
            ended up
            in Cleveland, Ohio. He was on the ground floor of some
            television
            programming that was happening there. He created and was the
            host of
            one
            of
            those classic late-night horror shows. And his character's name
            was
            Ghoulardi.
            [The show ran on WJW on Friday nights, from 1963 to 1966, and
            was an
            influence on everyone from Drew Carey to the Cramps.] He wore a
            fake
            Van
            Dyke beard and sunglasses with one lens popped out. His job was
            to
            introduce
            these horror films and show the kids a good time. Ghoulardi was
            an
            incredibly
            popular character locally in Cleveland. [My father] eventually
            came
            to
            Southern California, to the San Fernando Valley, and worked as a
            voice-over
            announcer with ABC, he did lots of diﬀerent commercials. He
            became
            the

            I've always thought of writing as something that you can do, or
            imagine
            yourself doing, simply because you have a pencil and a piece of
            paper.
            It's a
            great deal harder than that, but you have the instruments to do

            I loved to make films as soon as I could. I was lucky enough to
            be
            wanting to
            make films when it became much easier because the camcorder, the
            homemovie camera, came around. Steven Spielberg was the shining
            star,
            but he was
            working in Super 8, so you're actually cutting the film,
            splicing
            it
            or
            cementing
            it together. I had this device, this home-movie camera. It was
            huge
            and
            cumbersome, but you could immediately see the results. You could
            immediately
            put something together. You could learn rapidly. You could make
            a
            horrible
            movie one day then not a bad one the next day and then another
            one
            and
            then
            another one. You were able to keep practicing.

            I was so young when I made my first film, but I was incredibly
            self-conscious
            and prepared. I was prepared because I knew I was the youngest
            person on
            the
            set and I didn't want to let everybody down. There were a lot of
            people
            around
            me who'd been doing it for ten, fifteen, even twenty years. I
            really
            didn't want to
            be the reason why we slowed down. I'd already worked as a P.A.
            on so
            many
            film sets, so I was aware of what made a good film set work and
            what
            didn't. It
            was always a matter of communication. I was the person who was
            there
            helping
            to get coﬀee, knowing that no one knows what's going on.
            Everybody
            is
            bumping into one another. A film set can get like that. I could
            see
            examples of
            why something was running smoothly; there's a good line of
            communication.
            You don't have to be screaming. Yes, there's a dictator, but it
            can
            be a
            benevolent dictator. It doesn't require this kind of
            mythological,
            screaming,
            chaps-wearing, bullhorn thing. It's just about organization and
            communication.
            You can have fun doing it and be kind and get it done.

            You read about Hitchcock, who had everything mapped out,
            storyboarded,
            every shot prepared. Meticulous. The film is almost pre-edited.
            Then
            there's
            someone like Jean-Luc Godard, who's improvising, writing the
            script
            for
            the
            day that morning, and there is a kind of haphazard, or seemingly
            haphazard,
            way of going about it. Your films always have a voice. I rush to
            see
            them
            because I always know I'm hearing from you in the most personal
            way,
            whether the film is set in London or in the San Fernando
            Valley—stories
            of
            radically diﬀerent kinds. How much of that comes out of the
            writing?
            Is
            the
            writing the most crucial element of the creative process for
            you?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            It all begins and ends with the writing. That's an exaggeration,
            but
            the
            point of
            that is to say that, if the writing is good, you've got a very
            good
            shot
            at making
            a good film—or you've got a good shot of making your day. You've
            got
            some
            clarity that you're walking into the situation with. And the
            reason
            you
            know is
            because when you write a scene that doesn't work, you generally
            spend
            way too
            much time trying to do it. You spend too much time reshooting
            it,
            rewriting it,
            trying it a hundred diﬀerent ways. And then you realize this
            thing
            doesn't
            belong in the film.

            Most of the time, you know. Sometimes you think, This is the
            greatest
            scene
            that we have in this movie. And then something tells you, No,
            you
            don't
            need
            this. I mean, that's the trick. It's like, after this many
            years,
            you'd
            think you'd be
            able to spot it quicker. Actually, this time I had some scenes
            that
            I
            wrote that
            just were not working. And I would say to Alana and Cooper,
            What if
            you
            didn't say any of this dumb dialogue that I wrote and you just
            walked
            and
            silently looked at each other? And it was great. We'd have this
            magical
            thing.
            And it was a classic example of too much dialogue—enough with
            the
            writing!

            with
            her two sisters, Este and Danielle. There's a certain audacity
            in
            picking those
            two as lead actors for a major film. Until now, we knew Cooper
            Hoﬀman
            mainly as a <q>son of</q> and Alana Haim as a musician. Why'd you

            I swear if you were in my position, the question would be, How
            could
            you
            not
            choose them? I happen to know them. I knew Alana certainly had
            the
            talent
            and the competence from her years as a performer. I knew Cooper
            had
            the
            heart and the soulfulness. It was unclear whether he could
            really—you
            can
            never know if someone's going to have that kind of talent in
            front
            of
            your eyes.
            Or when you turn on a movie camera and they become, like,
            Pee-wee
            Herman
            in <q>Pee-wee's Big Adventure</q> when he's staring into the camera
            or
            mouthing
            the other person's line. I mean, it's always possible—believe
            me.
            But
            the more
            that we read the script together and hung out together and
            really
            investigated
            this as a real possibility, it just seemed like a far less
            complicated
            choice than
            you might imagine. It was looking for two authentic, genuine
            people
            who
            can't
            hide their emotions. And here they are right in front of me, and
            they
            want to
            learn, and they want to try really hard, and they don't want to
            let
            me
            down.
            They don't want to let themselves down. How could we not do
            this?
            This

            There was a traditional casting process when it came to the Gary

            do
            it.
            I guess I
            was sort of playing by the numbers. Maybe there's a kid out
            there
            and I
            can find
            him. That went on for quite a long time, unsuccessfully. I
            mentioned
            Cooper's
            name to Alana, Danielle, Este, the three [Haim] sisters. They
            talk
            all
            the time,
            these sisters. They're always talking all over one another. And
            when

            do they resemble each other in any way? Both as people and as

            that

        <p class="answer">
            That's a great question. And I've thought about it a little bit
            lately.
            There's a lot
            of money out there right now for people to make movies. When I
            started
            making films, there was a lot of money out there for a window of
            time,
            and it
            was home-video money. If you could make a movie for, let's say,
            a
            million and a
            half, two million dollars, keep it under three, and you had a
            couple
            of
            genre
            elements, there was the home-video component to making a film
            that
            needed
            to be fed. Which is essentially the same as streaming—call it
            home
            video,
            VHS, whatever you want to call it. It's something that gets into
            your
            house and
            gives you entertainment, right? So the playing field hasn't
            changed
            that
            drastically, you know? There's some money out there.

            get so
            lost in the

            viewer's

            Are you interested at all in making things for television?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            I wouldn't say no, but I wouldn't know where to begin. I had
            this
            conversation
            with Quentin [Tarantino]: I think neither one of us has a
            problem
            with
            writing
            material. Sometimes the problem can be cutting material, you
            know?
            Sometimes you're in the middle of writing something and you have
            way
            more
            than you need and you go, Well, maybe this should be a TV show,
            you
            know?
            That's not the solution. The solution is not to just use a lot
            of
            B-material and
            make a longer-form thing. The solution would be cut down, get to
            your
            good
            material, tell your story properly and make a film. So, I've
            never
            thought about
            it in a very serious way. I don't watch a lot of it, so I don't
            know
            exactly how it
            works. The structure is something I'd have to learn, you know. I
            don't
            mean to
            sound like an idiot. Of course I've seen episodic television,
            but
            there's a rhythm
            to that writing and a structuring of how you pull a story over
            multiple
            episodes,
            which at this point would be a huge learning curve. The people
            who
            do
            it, do it
            incredibly well. I think I'd feel a little bit like a tourist

            step into that.

            want to have that dialogue?

        <p class="answer">
            Did you ever see the Kevin Brownlow documentary called
            <q>Hollywood</q>?
            It
            was
            made in [1980] and is a multipart series on the silent era. And
            what's
            amazing
            about it is that, in 1980, most of those people were still
            alive. He
            filmed
            everyone from film directors to stuntmen and movie stars,
            reminiscing
            about
            the beginning, the real beginning, like, 1917. I was reading
            [the
            cinematographer] Billy Bitzer's autobiography recently; he's
            talking
            about
            coming out from New York with D. W. Griﬃth and getting started.
            That
            kind
            of stuﬀ has really been getting me emotional. I knew a little
            bit
            about
            it, but
            you realize that you could spend your whole life dedicated to it
            and
            still not
            know much of anything. I think back to any of those
            silent-movie-era
            filmmakers, whether it's D. W. Griﬃth or Raoul Walsh; even
            Howard
            Hawks
            started in silent films. So talking with anybody who was on the
            cusp,
            between
            the silents and sound, would be interesting. I'd love to hear
            those
            stories, have
            those conversations.
