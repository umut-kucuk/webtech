          In <span class="place">Europe</span>, particularly in <span class="verticalRight"><span
              class="place">Italy</span></span>, comics were long designed for and
          targeted at a male audience of young boys and teens. Comics in book
          format weren’t entirely absent from the Italian publishing landscape
          before the Second World War, but they were mostly editions printed by
          bookshops with Disney-type stories and often marketed as gifts. In the
          eyes of historian <span class="person">Gianni Bono</span>,
          <a href="https://www.guidafumettoitaliano.com/edicola-e-dintorni/le-burle-di-furbicchio" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Le burle di Furbicchio ai maghi </em></a><time datetime="1924">(1924)</time>
          was the first Italian comic,
          while
          professor <span class="person">Fabio Gadducci</span>
          dared to move the birth of the Italian graphic novel all the way back to
          1870, the year when
          <a href="https://www.fumettologica.it/galleria/pasquino-allistmo-di-suez-di-casimiro-teja/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pasquino all’Istmo di Suez</em></a>

          In any event, since their origin, Italian comics have always relied
          heavily on foreign production, particularly American. Even popular
          Italian series like <em>S.K.1 </em><time datetime="1935">(1935)</time> and
          <em>Ciclo della Malesia</em> <time datetime="1936">(1936)</time> by

        The anthology in which the character was first introduced—<a
          href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/albo-uragano/4050-28432/">Albi
          Uragano</a>—took the name of its main character, but after twenty issues it
        went out of print. When the Italian editor <span class="person"><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Civita">Cesare
            Civita</a></span> emigrated to
        <span class="place">Argentina</span> following the introduction of racial laws in <span
          class="place">Italy</span> and bought
        the rights to the headline characters for his own Editorial Abril, he
        also suggested the authors move to <span class="place">Buenos Aires</span> with him. It was then
        that the so-called “Venice Group” split in two. Those who left,
        including Pratt and Ongaro, came into contact with local Argentinian
        authors such as <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9ctor_Germ%C3%A1n_Oesterheld">
            Héctor Germán
            Oesterheld</a></span>, who would later create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eternaut"> El
          Eternauta</a> (1957-59). A few years later they founded a true
        Italo-Argentinian school of comics that would inspire a new generation
        of comic book authors.

      <h2>The fumetto nero</h2>
      <p>The 1960s were a particularly interesting and fruitful period for European comics. It was during this decade
        that
        the comic book became a widespread phenomenon. In <span class="place">Italy</span>, events seemed to be
        conspiring to push comic books into
        the public and critical spotlight. It was in <time datetime="1962">1962</time> that readers were introduced to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabolik">Diabolik</a>, a character and
        antihero par excellence partly inspired by the fictional hero <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fant%C3%B4mas">Fantômas</a>.
      </p>
      <p>A thief of exceptional abilities, a master of disguise, and a ruthless assassin, depending on what the
        situation
        called for, the character in black tights created by the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_and_Luciana_Giussani"> Giussani</a> sisters was something
        completely
        different from
        any other hero that had ever stepped out of the pages of adventure comics. On the cover of the first issue of
        Diabolik (Il re del terrore, or “The King of Terror”) was the mention, romanzo completo (“complete novel”), and
        for good reason. It did indeed look like a novel. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topolino">
          Topolino</a> (Mickey Mouse) pocket book format, published by
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnoldo_Mondadori_Editore"> Arnoldo Mondadori Editore</a> starting in
        <time datetime="1949">1949</time>,
        had set the precedent for novel-sized comic books. Over time, this
        format would become a point of reference for many notable imitations, such as Braccio di Ferro (Popeye), <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiramolla">Tiramolla</a>
        (Roll-Spring) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geppo"> Geppo</a>, often created by the same authors
        working on Disney characters elsewhere. However, in
        most cases, these were anthologies. The stories of Diabolik were mostly resolved in single issues: narratives of
        a
        certain length that could stand alone, even if they could technically be considered serials, with some recurring
        characters and situations.
      </p>
      <p>If Fantômas became a favorite of the surrealists because the stories of his cruelty, lust and anarchism were
        never wrapped up in a happy ending, Diabolik was the bugbear of conformists and educators who couldn’t put up
        with
        his lack of principles.</p>
      <div class="shapes">
        <div class="circle-1"></div>
        <div class="triangle-2"></div>
        <div class="rectangle-1"></div>
        <div class="triangle-1"></div>
      </div>
      <p><em>Diabolik</em> shocked the paternalistic, moralistic and prudish publishing industry of the time and in so
        doing launched the so-called <em>fumetto nero</em> phenomenon (literally “black comic”). The success of the
        <em>fumetti neri</em>, which often had the letter ‘K’ somewhere in the title—e.g., <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriminal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Kriminal</em></a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanik" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Satanik</em></a>,
        <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/zakimort/4005-2314/" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Zakimort</em></a>, etc.—managed to scandalize representatives of the Catholic
        Church and political organizations across the board. Even the Italian parliament spoke out against the comic.

      <p class="image-desc">The first volume of "Kriminal," published in <time datetime="1964">1964</time> (© Editoriale
        Corno).</p>
      <p>These imitators of <em>Diabolik,</em> which happens to be the only <em>fumetto nero</em> still published today,
        exploited the most sensational features of Angela and Luciana Giussani’s character, amplifying the effects:
        sadism
        replaced violence and subtle eroticism became sex verging on the pornographic. Many of these comics were
        translated
        and sold well abroad, especially in <span class="place">France</span>. Some famous contemporary authors even
        learned the ropes from working
        on
        these productions, often thrown together hastily and badly printed. The Italian <em>fumetti neri</em> were in
        fact
        marketed as comics for adults (even if they were often read by teenagers as well). However, the “for adults
        only”
        and “not for sale to minors” warnings on the covers weren’t enough to placate the most zealous moralists, whose
        beliefs and prejudices finally managed to gain the upper hand. Their indignation often led to court cases and
        some
        publishers were even forced to close their doors.</p>
      <p>Despite the questionable value of the individual products, these comics were considered a modern and unifying
        phenomenon that brought pre-war productions up to date: in many ways they were more in line with contemporary
        public taste, as readers had already moved away from what educators and teachers were proposing at the time.</p>

      <h2>The Bonelli format</h2>
      <p>The story of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Bonelli_Editore" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Bonelli</a> format is similar to what happened in the <span class="place">United
          States</span>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tex_Willer" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tex</em></a>
        (1948), Bonelli’s first great success, was originally published as a comic strip (16.5 x 9 cm). The profits from
        these publications were then used to produce stories known as <em>raccoltine </em>(“little collections”). In
        <time datetime="1954">1954</time>,
        the first attempt at a chronological series in comic book format was made, but it was only from <time
          datetime="1958">1958</time> on that the
        “Bonelli format”—100-page comic books measuring 16 x 21 cm—was adopted.
      </p>
      <p>Especially after the great success of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Dog" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dylan Dog</em></a> series, the format became so successful that the market was
        invaded by “bonellidi,” or comic books from other publishing houses printed in the same format as the Bonelli
        comic books that often mimicked their style and structure. Not really a pocket book like <em>Diabolik</em> and
        the
        other <em>fumetti neri</em>, the Bonelli format was distinguished by its page count—100 as opposed to the 48 of
        the Franco-Belgian format—which allowed serialized narratives more breathing room. As had happened with
        <em>Diabolik</em> and the French graphic novels, both commercial and social factors led to the adoption of this
        particular format, the most successful in <span class="place">Italy</span> and one of the most successful
        worldwide.

      <p><span class="person">Sergio Bonelli</span> remembered the genesis of his publishing house’s pocket book format
        like this:</p>
      <p>&#8220;My mother Tea and I realized that the public was changing, that it wanted a longer read than what was
        being offered by comic books of the time, that people had more money and therefore could indulge in something
        more
        sophisticated. We also realized that people no longer wanted to wait a week to read a story that would take them
        just a few minutes to finish.&#8221;</p>
      <p>Bonelli’s serial structure allowed for greater stylistic and narrative variation and a more varied product than
        what was being produced by other commercial publishing houses at the time, American superhero comics included.
        Bonelli always aimed at the immediate recognizability of its products, stamping its books with a style that was
        its strength, but at the same time its greatest limitation. Regardless, the Bonelli style undoubtedly set the
        standard for comic books in <span class="place">Italy</span>. Given its strong position in the Italian comic
        book market, the Bonelli comic
        book became a benchmark for many other publications, which rarely, however, experienced comparable success.</p>
      <h2>The era of Italian magazines: rise and fall</h2>
      <p>The magazines published in <span class="place">Italy</span> from the mid-‘60s onward played a crucial role in
        paving the way for the
        acceptance and promotion of a new type of contemporary, more sophisticated comic book. The first real magazine
        dedicated to the “adult” comic book was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_(magazine)" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Linus</em></a>, first published in <time datetime="1965">1965</time> by <span
          class="person">Giovanni Gandini</span>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.lambiek.net/artists/c/crepax.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crepax</a> and
        <a href="https://www.lambiek.net/artists/l/lunari_enzo.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lunari</a>
        were the first two Italian authors to appear in the pages of <em>Linus</em>, which was initially inspired by
        foreign—mostly American—comics, which were the sole focus of critical attention at the time. But <em>Linus
        </em>was also to become a haven for many authors, contemporary and future, who found there the space and
        opportunity to write about their own work. In subsequent years, political issues and current events would appear
        as comics in the magazine’s pages almost in real time.

          datetime="1965">1965</time>).</p>
      <p><em>Linus</em> was followed by a number of competitors and imitators. The second half of the ‘70s saw the
        launch
        of two new weekly titles, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanciostory" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Lanciostory</em></a> (1975) and <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skorpio_(magazine)" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Skorpio</em></a> (1977), by Editorial Eura (now <a
          href="https://www.editorialeaurea.it/index.php?EDITORE=EDITORIALE%20AUREA&amp;langCode=en" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Editorial Aurea</a>), which initially featured the work of South American authors
        before opening up to the Franco-Belgian market.</p>
      <p>The ‘80s were perhaps the most fruitful years for Italian comics. Many new magazines were published, including
        <em>Totem</em> (1980), much of whose material had previously appeared in <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9tal_hurlant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Métal
            Hurlant</em></a> (an Italian version of the French magazine was published in the same year); <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corto_Maltese#Publication_history" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Corto Maltese</em></a> (1983), which published primarily Italian authors; <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eternaut" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>L’Eternauta</em></a> (1980), which initially concentrated on Argentinian and
        Spanish authors; and <em>Comic Art</em> (1984) by the same publisher. The success of these magazines soon began
        to
        wane, however, partly due to competition from commercial television and partly due to a renewed interest in
        popular comics.

      <p>The ‘90s saw some interesting, albeit short-lived, projects. The monthly Nova Express by Granata Press managed

        remain in print from <time datetime="1991">1991</time> to <time datetime="1993">1993</time>, despite a slew of

        specialized in manga, was more successful (1992-2006) thanks to
        the
        great popularity Japanese comics enjoyed in <span class="place">Italy</span> at the time, and the fact that the
        magazine was serialized.

        arrival of Zero (Granata Press), the first magazine in Europe completely dedicated to Japanese manga, dates back

          Comics</a>, <time datetime="1996">1996</time>) was particularly important for its promotion of new talent in
        <span class="place">Italy</span>, and <em>Il Grifo
        </em>(1991-1995) was effectively an art magazine dedicated to comics. By the mid-‘90s, the comic book had become
        entrenched in Italian culture. The comic book had become art. The fact was no longer in doubt. Comics could now
        speak for themselves.</p>
      <p>The decline of the comics magazines, which continue to struggle to find stable footing in the editorial market,
        has also marked the partial abandonment of the short story form. From the mid-‘90s onwards, long-form stories
        came
        into vogue, above all the graphic novel.</p>

      <h2>Publishing houses and the graphic novel</h2>
      <p>At the end of the 1990s, when the age of magazines was drawing to a close, a number of publishing houses sprung
        up and played an important role in transforming the comic book into a commercial product. In <time
          datetime="1996">1996</time>, thanks to
        <span class="person">Andrea Plazzi</span> and <span class="person">Edoardo Rosati</span>, Edizioni PuntoZero was
        born, which aside from publishing essays on cinema,
        animation and comic books, also published work by different comics writers. When PuntoZero closed in <time
          datetime="2001">2001</time>, its
        catalogue was taken over by <a

          rel="noopener noreferrer">Kappa Edizioni</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Black Velvet was created in <time datetime="1997">1997</time> by <span class="person">Omar Martini</span> and
        <span class="person">Luca Bernardi</span>. The publisher first distinguished itself by
        focusing on the American market, before opening up to other countries’ authors as well (for example, Scandinavia
        with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_(cartoonist)" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason</a>, <span class="place">Spain</span> with <a

        while at home it promoted Italian authors like <span class="person"><a

      <p><em>Comic Art, la rivista dello spettacolo disegnato</em> published its last issue in <time
          datetime="2000">2000</time>, marking in many
        ways
        the end of the era of the comics magazines. The future of this medium was clearly in book format. The same year,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconino_Press" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coconino
          Press</a> was founded in Bologna by comic book artist <a href="https://www.lambiek.net/artists/i/igort.htm"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Igort</a> (<span class="person">Igor Tuveri</span>), distributor
        Carlo Barbieri, and businessman
        Simone Romani. The name they chose immediately suggested the mission of the publishing house. <span
          class="place">Coconino County</span> in
        <span class="place">Arizona</span> was the backdrop for the surreal adventures of <a

            rel="noopener noreferrer">George
            Herriman</a></span>. With a focus on foreign creations and a high level of editorial attention, Coconino
        Press was a
        real comic book author’s press. Thanks to the extensive network of contacts amassed by Igort throughout his
        career, Coconino launched numerous international co-editions.
      </p>
      <p>Coconino Press grew quickly and today publishes more than twenty collections. Its objective was and remains
        clear: to move beyond the newsstand to specialized comic book stores and even bookstores.</p>
      <p>The Latina-based publishing house <a href="https://www.tunue.com/" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Tunué</a> was founded in 2004 by its current publishing director <span
          class="person">Massimiliano
          Clemente</span>
        and manager <span class="person">Emanuele Di Giorgi</span>. Tunué initially specialized in essays about comics
        and visual imagery, but very
        quickly filled its catalogue with its own graphic novels. The first volumes of the series <em>Graphic Novel</em>
        were mainly created by young Italian authors, some just starting out, but very soon international authors filled
        out the ranks.</p>
      <p>Tunué’s work is also known to cater to young readers. In <time datetime="2010">2010</time>, <em>Tipitondi</em>
        arrived, a series of comic
        books aimed at children and young adults. From <time datetime="2011">2011</time>, Tunué even started to publish
        novels, unlike many
        publishing
        houses that started with novels and moved into comics.</p>

          href="https://www.baopublishing.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BAO Publishing</a> quickly
        dominated the Italian scene with a
        catalog that boasted
        over 350 titles after just a few years of operation. BAO’s international, multi-genre comics feature work from
        many countries, including the <span class="place">United States</span>, <span class="place">Japan</span> and
        <span class="place">Europe</span>. Their publications range from children’s comics
        to
        genre comics and include adult graphic novels, superhero comics, recent <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Bonelli_Editore" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Bonelli</a> re-releases, deluxe editions, and experimental comic books.</p>
      <p>In <time datetime="2011">2011</time>, BAO published the graphic novel <em>La Profezia dell’armadillo</em>
        (&#8220;The Armadillo
        Prophecy&#8221;), a collection of autobiographical stories held together by a unique fragmented narrative. The
        narrator is the protagonist of the book and he moves between contemporary satire, generational and nostalgic
        accounts, and ironic reflections on the daily life of twenty- to thirty-year-olds with a graphic style that
        embraces influences from underground comics, street art and manga. The first edition of <em>La</em> <em>Profezia
          dell’armadillo</em>, created by <a href="https://www.europecomics.com/author/zerocalcare/" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Zerocalcare</a> and Makkox (Marco D’Ambrosio), was printed in a limited run of 500
        and
        sold online. Five subsequent reprints brought the overall total to over 3,000 copies. Following this success,
        BAO
        released a color version of the book, now in its thirteenth print run with over 50,000 copies sold. BAO has also
        produced Zerocalcare’s other books, which, with the help of the author’s blog, have steadily climbed to the top
        of
        the charts, making the author one of the most important publishing phenomena of recent years.</p>

      <h2>Italian press (today) and the graphic novel</h2>
      <p>The comic book (or graphic novel) has long been a significant player in the Italian publishing market. The
        commercial success of the graphic novel has given publishers the leverage to shelve their comic books in the
        fiction sections of bookstores, far from the newsstands and specialized comic and art book stores. This hybrid
        form—which combines the textual complexity of a novel and the visual richness of a comic book—has attracted a
        new
        adult reading public.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if the comic book market has grown so much and the stories themselves are so important and
        universal,
        why are they not discussed more? The Italian press and television networks have very little room for culture,
        but
        the quality is often high. If there’s so much hype surrounding comics and graphic novels, if there is such
        sustained interest from the reading public, if it is assumed that comics are not being marginalized but are
        marginalizing themselves (even if the successful marketing campaigns waged by many publishing houses in the last
        few years seem to suggest the opposite), why are they still not discussed more? Why are there not more
        broadcasts,
        news stories or articles? If the success of Zerocalcare manages to change this for the better, it will be a
        great
        victory, and all the ifs and buts at play here won’t weigh so heavily. If not, comics will once again recede,
        waiting for the next big name to re-emerge into the spotlight.</p>
