      <h2>Before Wonder Woman, an even more groundbreaking female crimefighter kept humankind safe. As she turns 80,
        <span class="person">Nicholas Barber</span> pays tribute to her and her unfairly forgotten creator.</h2>
      <p>This autumn sees the 80th anniversary of Wonder Woman, who made her comics debut in <time datetime="1941-10">October 1941</time>, two years
        after Batman and three years after Superman. But before we start celebrating, we should raise a glass to
        another, even more groundbreaking superheroine who swung into action six months earlier, in <time datetime="1941-04">April 1941</time>. Her name
        was Miss Fury. Written and drawn by <span class="person">June Tarpé Mills</span>, she was the first superheroine to be created by a woman,
        which is one of many reasons why she is still so inspirational, eight decades on. Her devotees include <span class="person">Maria
        Laura Sanapo</span>, an Italian comics artist. "I think that the birth of Miss Fury can be considered the beginning of
        a new era," Sanapo tells BBC Culture.</p>
      <p><span class="person">Mills</span> was born in <span class="place">Brooklyn</span>, <span class="place">New York</span> either in <time datetime="1912">1912</time> or <time datetime="1918">1918</time>, according to different sources. Raised by her
        widowed mother and their relatives, she worked as a model and a fashion illustrator before selling her first
        comic strips in the late 1930s, featuring the escapades of such two-fisted swashbucklers as The Purple Zombie,
        Mann of India, and Daredevil Barry Finn (not to mention his amphibious sidekick, Frogga). But when <span class="person">Mills</span> signed
        those strips, she dropped the "June" in favour of her androgynous middle name (her mother's maiden name), so
        that she would be known as <span class="person">Tarpé Mills</span>. "It would have been a major letdown to the kids if they found out that
        the author of such virile and awesome characters was a gal," she told the New York Post a sentiment which would
        be echoed by <span class="person">Joanne Rowling</span> nearly 60 years later when choosing the pen name JK.</p>

        century before Catwoman came on the scene (Credit: <span class="person">June Tarpé Mills</span>)</p>
      <p>However Mills's true identity didn't stay hidden for long. Her big break was a weekly Sunday newspaper strip
        about someone who was just as awesome as Daredevil Barry Finn  but who, the publicity materials emphasised,
        borrowed her indomitable personality and her glamorous, raven-haired looks from Mills herself. The first Miss
        Fury strips (or rather, Black Fury strips, until Mills changed the title shortly afterwards) are a sort of
        distaff pastiche of Batman. They introduce <span class="person">Marla Drake</span>, a New York socialite who is about to go to a fancy-dress
        party in a frilly red Scarlett O’Hara gown when a friend phones to say that someone else has picked the same
        outfit. Over-reacting slightly, Marla shreds the dress with her bare hands, thus affording readers a glimpse of
        her stockings and suspenders, but her understandably perturbed French maid Francine has a suggestion: "Why not
        wear the black leopard skin your uncle left you?" Presumably, <span class="person">Mills</span> was getting panthers and leopards mixed up.
        She also falls back on the exoticising clichés of the time and establishes that the skin was a ceremonial robe
        worn by an African witch doctor. But it just so happens to be a slinky jumpsuit, complete with cat-eared mask,
        claws and tail. This, don't forget, was a quarter of a century before Catwoman and Black Panther began wearing
        almost identical costumes  and in French, incidentally, the character was called La Panthère Noire.

      <h2>Comics were usually aimed either at boys or girls in the 1940s, but <span class="person">June Tarpé Mills</span> mashed up genres to make
        a unique hybrid - <span class="person">Mike Madrid</span></h2>
      <p>Marla learns that the skin-tight ceremonial robe is "endowed with strange powers which enabled its wearer to
        accomplish whatever mission he or she set out upon". All of a sudden, she is outsmarting and outfighting tough
        guys in suits and trilbies, and her crime-busting exploits are hitting the gossip columns: "This black-clad
        venus must be a veritable feline fury!" But a strip that promises to be a hardboiled New York-gangster serial
        gets more outlandish and outrageous at breathtaking speed. Within a few weeks, Marla is entangled in the
        blackmail schemes of the gold-digging Baroness Erica Von Kampf, whose triangular fringe hides a swastika that
        has been branded on her forehead. Within a few more, Marla is teaming up with an albino Brazilian tribesman, and
        defeating the army of General Bruno, a monocled Nazi who lost an arm in an explosion after he taped a bomb to
        Marla's pet cat. "It really felt as though anything could happen," says <span class="person">Mike Madrid</span>, the author of The
        Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines. "Comics were usually aimed
        either at boys or girls in the 1940s, but Mills mashed up genres to make a unique hybrid of superhero, romance,
        adventure, western and war comic."</p>
      <h3>A very modern action woman</h3>
      <p>Miss Fury herself was unique, too. "She doesn't have a lot of physical strength, so she uses her intelligence
        to find ways to fight back," says <span class="person">Chelsea Stone</span>, the director of <a
          href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13153464/" alt="Documentary about Mills">a new documentary about <span class="person">Mills</span></a>.
        "She thinks on
        her feet. She's also a hopeless romantic who loves fashion. I think a lot of female characters were and still
        are one-dimensional, but <span class="person">Tarpé Mills</span> knew that real women aren't like that, and she created her characters
        accordingly."</p>
      <p>Marla was a proudly modern, proto-feminist heroine. She had various handsome suitors who pined for her rather
        than the other way around; she had a job in fashion design; and she even adopted her arch-enemy's toddler and
        became a single, unmarried mother - a status that was unheard of in comics at the time. "She stood for all the
        women of that period," says Sanapo, "who had a role in the reconstruction of their country while the men were at
        war".</p>
      <h2>I love how practical Marla Drake is even when she's wearing the most dazzling gown - <span class="person">Corinna Bechko</span></h2>
      <p>One sign of the character's modernity is that months could pass without her putting on her black catsuit at all
        - not that that stopped her travelling the world and punching Nazi spies. "In a number of 1940s comics," says
        <span class="person">Madrid</span>, "you had female characters who couldn't express themselves in their everyday lives. They had to conform
        to the standards of society, so they would be secretaries who were treated as "plain Janes", or they'd be
        debutantes who acted as if they were vacuous and bored. They were only liberated when they put on their costumes
        and went out to fight evil-doers. And these were characters who were written by men. What's different about
        Marla Drake is that she already lives her life with a certain degree of freedom, so the costume is not something
        she relies on. It seems like a uniquely practical and female interpretation of a character with a secret
        identity."</p>

      <p>Besides, you couldn't blame Marla for leaving her black costume in the cupboard when she had a seemingly
        endless supply of fabulous 1940s clothes to choose from. As well as its unpredictable plotting and its
        independent leading lady, the strip's appeal had a lot to do with Mills's intricate drawings of the trendiest
        suits, shoes, hats and dresses. Whether she is parachuting from a burning plane, or wrestling with the Baroness
        on a penthouse balcony, Marla sports nothing but the finest in figure-hugging haute couture. "I love how
        practical Marla Drake is even when she's wearing the most dazzling gown," says <span class="person">Corinna Bechko</span>, the writer of
        numerous Star Wars, Alien and Wonder Woman comics. "<span class="person">Mills</span> proved that a woman could write and draw a comic
        strip, include things that are traditionally thought of as feminine, like fashion and motherhood, and still have
        the heroine be a total badass."</p>
      <p>Naturally, wearing all of those different dresses meant that Marla had to get changed regularly: <span class="person">Mills</span> often
        depicts her and and the Baroness swanning around their apartments in their lingerie, and luxuriating in their
        baths, so the strip offered far more titillating beauties than Batman or Wonder Woman ever did. The censors
        weren't always pleased. When one of Marla's statuesque associates squeezed into a leaf-patterned bikini for a
        nightclub performance, several newspapers opted either to cover her torso with a blob of red ink, or to shelve
        that week's strip altogether. But readers were delighted by these painstakingly drawn, cartoonishly proportioned
        women: <span class="person">Mills</span> sent Miss Fury pin-ups to World War Two servicemen, and the character was painted on the noses of
        three American bombers.</p>
      <h2>Those were difficult times for a woman who wanted to be a cartoonist, and Mills needed more support than she
        got - <span class="person">Maria Laura Sanapo</span></h2>
      <p>As beloved as the strip was, though - at one point it was syndicated in 100 newspapers - it was cancelled in
        1951, exactly 10 years after it was first published. Partly this was because <span class="person">Mills</span> had been missing deadlines:
        she was a chain-smoker with lung problems, and her dedication to her meticulous artwork took its toll. But
        partly, argue some commentators, it was because the exploits of a go-getting, self-reliant woman no longer
        suited the sensibilities of conservative post-war <span class="place">America</span>. <span class="person">Mills</span> survived as a commercial artist, but she never
        made a comeback in comics. "Those were difficult times for a woman who wanted to be a cartoonist," says <span class="person">Sanapo</span>,
        "and <span class="person">Mills</span> needed more support than she got. She was so far ahead of her time, but she was so underestimated".
        She lived her last years as a recluse in a rundown <span class="place">Brooklyn</span> apartment, labouring over an unfinished graphic
        novel. And when she died in <time datetime="1988">1988</time>, Miss Fury was all but forgotten - a cruel fate for such an iconic
        superheroine. "Honestly, I think it's because she's not part of a large, well-known universe [like Marvel and
        DC's superheroes]," says <span class="person">Bechko</span>. "And also because she kind of gets swamped by Catwoman, who is a very different
        character even though she sometimes has a similar look."</p>
      <p>Still, Miss Fury has proven to be a leopard / panther with nine lives. Other writers and artists have revived
        her: <span class="person">Bechko</span> has written a series of Miss Fury comics for Dynamite Entertainment, and Sanapo has illustrated one.
        <span class="person">Mills</span>'s own work has recently been reprinted in lavish hardback collections, with introductions by <span class="person">Trina
        Robbins</span>, a fellow Brooklyn-born comics innovator. And in <time datetime="2019">2019</time> <span class="person">Mills</span> herself was inducted into the American
        comics industry's Eisner Award Hall Of Fame - a mere 13 years after <span class="person">William Moulton Marson</span>, the creator of
        Wonder Woman, and 23 years after <span class="person">Bob Kane</span>, the co-creator of Batman. To be fair, it's unlikely that Miss Fury
        will ever be as famous as they are, but in some ways she is just as significant. "There's been so much
        discussion in the last couple of decades about new interpretations of female characters in comics," says <span class="person">Madrid</span>,
        "and about female creators getting their view out into the world. <span class="person">Tarpé Mills</span> was already doing all that in the
        1940s".</p>
