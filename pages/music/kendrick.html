            <i>Insider is looking back on the last decade of musical greats with a series of opinion essays. Next up: Kendrick Lamar.</i>
            <br><br>
            Kendrick Lamar's major label debut "Good Kid, M.A.A.D City" was my entry point into music criticism as 
            a young, ambitious student journalist at Jackson State University.
            <br><br>
            In 2012, "GKMC" was one of the most anticipated albums that year after Lamar rode high from the universal 
            praise for his stellar indie debut "Section .80" (2011), a scene-stealing <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/kendrick-lamar-talks-bur
            ied-alive-and-drake-news.1015.html">interlude on Drake's sophomore opus 
            "Take Care," called "Buried Alive"</a>, and his inclusion on XXL's 2011 Freshman Class cover.
            <br><br>
            It was on a rainy October 22 night that my life changed after leaving the student publication building, 
            deflated after an editorial disagreement with a student editor. I was a volunteer staff writer for the school 
            paper then. Following a pep talk from the paper's advisor who doubled as my news writing professor to 
            "write about the things I was most passionate about," my best friend Brodrick eagerly called and told me, 
            "Mark, in the car, we're going to Best Buy! The album's out!"
            <br><br>
            Long story short, I rushed to the campus parking lot, hopped in his Chrysler 300 and from there we fled and 
            copped the album.
            <br><br>
            After we were left in awe during our first listen, I immediately spent the rest of the weekend writing my very 
            first album review that gave Lamar the same high praise as <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/music/good-kid-m
            aad-city/kendrick-lamar">nearly every other music outlet</a> did at the time. 
            "GKMC" was a rare, instant classic.
            <br><br>
            I am sharing this because it's stories like this — along with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/12/12/568748405/
            the-prophetic-struggle-of-kendrick-lamars-damn">accounts of Lamar's "DAMN." (2017) inspiring 
            a fan to become a better Christian</a>, and Tyler, the Creator and friendly rival J. Cole being <a href="https:
            //hiii-power.com/2019/05/24/tyler-the-creator-kendrick-lamar-igor/">musically 
            influenced</a> by their peer — that prove why Lamar is not only one of the defining leaders of his generation, 
            but one of the most culturally impactful and important artists of the decade.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Lamar is an unflinchingly honest storyteller who never compromised on either his core sound or his values
        </h2>
        <p class="big-letter">
            Through the combined powers of his foundational team at Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE), Interscope Records, 
            and the legendary Dr. Dre, Lamar quickly shattered many barriers in commercial music and entertainment 
            that historically plagued both gangster and "conscious" rappers.
            <br><br>
            While most of his influencers and predecessors like Mos Def, 2Pac, DMX, and MC Eiht to name a few, have all 
            earned notable record sales, Billboard chart rankings, and critical praise, they were never fully embraced 
            within the mainstream music machine between radio (excluding obvious exceptions) and notoriously, 
            <a href="https://www.insider.com/grammys-snubs-hip-hop-again-favors-apolitical-pop-2018-1">the Recording Academy</a>. 
            Despite <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/01/kendrick-lamar-loses-best-rap-album-to-macklemore-at-the-grammys
            -today-in-hip-hop/">losing the award for best rap album</a> at the 2014 Grammy Awards to Macklemore's
            "The Heist," Lamar went on to <a href="https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/kendrick-lamar">win 13 Grammys</a>, eight 
            BMI Awards, six Billboard Awards, and 17 ASCAP awards.

            His cultural impact was solidified after he was <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kend
            rick-lamar-named-generational-icon-by-california-senate-162939/">awarded with the California State Senate's Generational

             in his Compton stomping grounds in 2016, and <a href="https://www.insider.com/kendrick-lamar-becomes-first-rapper-to-win-a-pulitzer-prize-
             2018-4">became the first hip-hop artist to win a Pulitzer Prize for Music</a> in 2018 for "DAMN."
            <br><br>
            He achieved a dizzying amount of success that many assumed was unimaginable due to the thoughtful content of 
            his music and how he sounded different than anything that was out during the early 2010s.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Lamar thrived in a unique musical climate in the 2010s that saw free mixtapes get released online and independent 
            websites hosting the latest albums
        </h2>
        <p class="big-letter">
            During the early 2010s, a new generation of fans were tapping into artists such as Lamar himself, J. Cole, Rapsody, 
            Jay Rock, <a href="https://www.insider.com/nipsey-hussle-dead-legacy-charity-work-investments-south-la-2019-4">the late Nipsey Hussle</a>
            , Big Sean, Gucci Mane, Wiz Khalifa, and Meek Mill among many others who frequently 
            dropped free mixtapes and independent albums on platforms like DatPiff and LiveMixtapes.
            <br><br>
            His narratives on his life, neighborhood, spirituality, and societal issues, combined with top-notch lyricism and 
            warping vocal deliveries, got the attention of fans and critics alike. Writer Dorian Lynskey of <a ref="https://www.theguar
            dian.com/music/2018/apr/22/kendrick-lamar-wins-pulitzer-prize-damn-album">The Guardian</a> described 
            Lamar in an op-ed as "an extraordinarily vivid and unpredictable storyteller with a tendency to radically change his music, 
            vocal tone and lyrical direction midway through a song, zooming in or out so that the second half complicates and subverts 
            the first."
            <br><br>
            His influencer, Nas, also gave him similarly high praise in a 2014 interview with <a href="https://www.complex.com/music/20
            14/07/nas-kendrick-lamar-interview?utm_campaign=complexmag%2Bsocialflow%2B07%2B2014&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social">The Complex</a>.

            "There's not many like him. He's a breath of fresh air. His s--- is genius. This dude's a rhyming animal. I feel like he's 
            going to be one of the most important writers of our time as we watch him go forward. Without a question, you can already 
            see that. It's definitely a high that I always get from the music," he said.

        <h2>
            His music also became the lyrical backdrop of the greater Black Lives Matter movement
        </h2>
        <p class="big-letter">
            Lamar's Interscope debut "GKMC" was released a few months after the tragic killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. 
            His bolder follow-up, "To Pimp a Butterfly" (2015) and its single "Alright" featuring Pharrell, became <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/26/75
            3511135/kendrick-lamar-alright-american-anthem-party-protest">the unofficial 
            soundtrack to the Black Lives Matter movement</a> amid a continuing wave of fatal police violence against unarmed black Americans across the country.
            <br><br>
            Lyrics like, "N----, and we hate po-po / Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho' / N----, I'm at the preacher's door 
            / My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow / But we gon' be alright," were a rallying call heard from street corners 
            to protests signifying that despite the well-documented history of trauma that black Americans continue to endure, 
            we'll continue to find our ways to overcome our struggles and be OK.
            <br><br>
            The timing and cultural relevance of his work is what continues to make his music evergreen. 
        </p>
        <h2>
            On the financial front, Lamar's unapologetic blackness led to astonishing lucrative success 
        </h2>
        <p class="big-letter">
            On the road, he reportedly grossed a staggering $40,562,179 with an average of over $1.2 million per show during the 
            critically and commercially successful "DAMN." tour in 2017, according to <a href="https://www.pollstar.com/News/box-
            office-insider-kendrick-lamar-did-the-damn-thing-133778">Pollstar</a>. Lamar has made <a href="https://www.forbes

            Hip-Hop Cash Kings list in 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2018 earning millions of dollars in ways not limited to all three 
            of his platinum-selling albums (<a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/05/kendrick-lamar-black-panther-soundtrack
            -goes-platinum/">including the "Black Panther" soundtrack</a>), merchandise, and tour success.
            <br><br>
            From owning <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/kendrick-lamar-gets-his-start-in-the-real-estate-business-with-a-mansion-
            wBMD_4r_fkGa0Q_adEUw4g/">real estate</a> to his lucrative deals he's had with Reebok, Beats by Dre, Nike, Calvin Klein, and American 
            Express, Lamar's superstardom and impact on culture has allowed him to become a music and brand mogul in his own right. 
            The rapper has consistently been in demand in the entertainment business, and with <a href="https://footwearnews.com/2019/focus/a

            There are only a handful of artists in music whose legacies superseded the wealth and fame they've accumulated throughout 
            their careers. And while Lamar has plenty of that, the strongest parts of his legacies go beyond it all. While he's been 
            <a href="https://thesource.com/2018/01/29/kendrick-lamar-tupacs-one-true-heir/">compared to the late Tupac Shakur</a> throughout 
            his career it's still far too premature to accurately gauge that influence. 
            But what can be said is that he has sparked a blaze behind a generation of current and future musicians, creatives, thinkers, 
            and writers alike.
            <br><br>
            And he did it all by being a very good kid in an even madder world.
