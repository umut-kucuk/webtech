        <h2>Step inside the mind of one of America’s great virtuosos,

                Behind his blistering trumpet solos, revolutionary vocal 
                improvising and exuberant stage persona, how did Louis 
                Armstrong see himself? What was it like to be the first 
                pop virtuoso of the recorded era — the man whose earliest 
                releases set the tune for America's love affair with modern 
                black music, and who went on to become one of history's most 
                famous entertainers?
                <br><br>
                Those questions aren't rhetorical. There's actually a deep well 
                of resources on hand to help answer them. For his entire adult life, 
                away from the spotlight, Armstrong amassed a huge trove of personal writings, 
                recordings and artifacts. But until this month, you would have had to travel far 
                into central Queens to find them. Now anyone can access them. Thanks to a $3 million 
                grant from the <a href="http://www.fund2foundation.org/">Fund II Foundation</a>
                — run by Robert F. Smith, the wealthiest African-American — 
                <a href="https://www.louisarmstronghouse.org/">the Louis Armstrong House Museum</a> 
                has digitized <a href="https://collections.louisarmstronghouse.org/">the entire collection he left behind and made 
                    it available to the public</a>    
                <br><br>
                Armstrong wrote hundreds of pages of memoir, commentary and jokes throughout his life, and sent 
                thousands of letters. He made collages and scrapbooks by the score. Over the final two decades 
                of his life, he recorded himself to reel-to-reel tapes constantly, capturing everything from 
                casual conversations to the modern music he was listening to.

                All told, Armstrong's is not just one of the most well documented private lives of any American artist. 
                It's one of the most creatively documented lives, too.
                <br><br>
                “Posterity drove him to write manuscripts and 
                make tapes and catalog everything,” said Ricky Riccardi, the director of research collections at the 
                Louis Armstrong House Museum and a noted Armstrong scholar. “He was just completely aware of his 
                importance and wanting to be in control of his own story.”
                <br><br>
                And it wasn't just posterity. The same things that drove him as a performer — faith in unfettered 
                communication, an irreverent approach to the strictures of language, the desire to wrap all of American 
                culture in his embrace — course through his writings, collages and home recordings.

                Armstrong had been largely responsible for shaping jazz into the worldly, youth-driven music it became 
                in the 1930s. He emerged as a symbol of racial pride, crossing Tin Pan Alley gentility with street patois,
                and sometimes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vDm1lomVHU">singing directly about black frustrations</a>. 
                But as his career went on, his grinning stage persona 
                — an expansion on the minstrel shows and New Orleans cabarets of his youth — fell out of step with most 
                African-American listeners' tastes. (“I loved the way Louis played trumpet, man, but I hated the way he 
                had to grin in order to get over with some tired white folks,” Miles Davis wrote in his autobiography.)
                <br><br>
                With jazz's identity solidifying as an art music in the 1950s, Armstrong became especially unfashionable 
                to the critical establishment. The autumnal hits he scored in the mid-1960s, “Hello, Dolly!” and “What a Wonderful World,” 
                seemed only to confirm the media consensus that the times had passed him by.
                <br><br>
                But these archives contain the tools for a better understanding of Armstrong: as idiosyncratic an artist as any, 
                one whose<br> creative instincts only grew deeper and broader over time.

                In part, we see a man attuned to race and politics, who took his role seriously as a global ambassador 
                for American culture and kept a close eye on the achievements of fellow African-Americans. When he spoke 
                out against school segregation in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957, he surprised the nation. Some activists said 
                it was too little, too late. The archive, however, shows that he considered it both a proud moment in his 
                career and wholly of a piece with his life up to that point. In the collection is a telegram he wrote to 
                President Dwight Eisenhower on the day Eisenhower announced he would be sending Army troops into Little Rock, 
                urging him “to take those little Negro children personally into Central High School along with your marvelous troops.” 
                <br><br>
                And as solicitous as he was, Armstrong was unwilling to let critical judgments define him. He kept a close eye on reviews, 
                but he wrote acerbically about music critics and sometimes taped his interviews with them — perhaps for evidence, 
                in case they misreported something. On one tape, from 1959, he barks at a journalist after being asked about changes 
                afoot in jazz. “I just live what I play, and I can't vouch for the other fellow. As long as I feel and hit the notes 
                and I've got my own audience, then no critic in the world can tell me how I should play my horn,” he says.

                Raised in New Orleans, Armstrong came to fame in his early 20s after joining King Olivers' Creole Jazz Band in Chicago; 
                his early recordings as a leader, with his Hot Five and Hot Seven, established jazz as a soloist's music, 
                and made him one of the first pop musicians of the radio era. By the 1940s and '50s he was regularly included on 
                lists of the most admired Americans. Starting in his 20s, Armstrong frequently clipped newspaper articles about himself 
                and bundled them into scrapbooks. The books began as a tool to convince club owners of his legitimacy, but they turned 
                into a historical record. The dozens of scrapbook binders contained in the archive are a window into his self-image as a 
                celebrity: Armstrong looking at us looking at him.

                Armstrong began his career as an idol to many African-Americans. Watch the well-circulated video clip of him 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZvqvNYJmC4">performing in Copenhagen in 1933</a> — bountiful and aggressive as he scats over “Dinah,” then carves his way through “Tiger Rag” with a 
                sweltering trumpet solo — and you'll get why. But as time wore on, many younger people, particularly musicians of the bebop 
                generation, expressed misgivings about his genuflecting stage persona. 
                <br><br>
                Armstrong's scrapbooks make it clear that he kept a 
                close eye on how he was perceived, as an artist and as a black statesman. 
                When he traveled to Baltimore in the winter of 1931, he donated 300 bags of coal to residents of a needy black neighborhood, 
                and privately saved <a href="https://collections.louisarmstronghouse.org/asset-detail/1197548">the news clipping</a> from The Baltimore Afro-American. When his band was arrested in Arkansas simply for 
                traveling in the same bus as its white manager, he saved 
                <a href="https://collections.louisarmstronghouse.org/asset-detail/1206466">the article reporting it </a>.
                <br><br>
                And when a blatantly racist British critic referred to him as “Mr. Ugly” the following year 
                (“He looks, and behaves, like an untrained gorilla,” the article read), Armstrong kept a copy of that too. 
                Reading what arts journalism was like in the late '20s and '30s, it becomes obvious how narrow the berth was for a public 
                figure like Armstrong to emerge onto the national stage.

                Armstrong wrote constantly — mostly letters and short stories about his life, but also in the form of limericks and pages-long 
                jokes. He wrote in a galloping, oddly punctuated style, treating literature almost as an outsider art. Commas turned into apostrophes; 
                jive talk collided with standard English; words were underlined all over. His musical originality is matched on the page.
                <br><br>
                When Armstrong joined King Oliver's famed band, he brought along a typewriter. By 1936, when he was in his mid-30s, he had already 
                published an autobiography. Over the course of his career he wrote more than 10,000 <a href="https://collections.louisarmstronghouse.org/asset-detail/1000881"
                >letters to fans</a>, hundreds of pages of personal 
                memoirs and enough <a href="https://collections.louisarmstronghouse.org/asset-detail/1067188">lengthy jokes</a> to fill an entire book.
                <br><br>
                In 1969 and '70, with his health failing, Armstrong set about writing a long essay about his relationship with the Karnofskys, 
                a Jewish family in New Orleans. When he was 7, he worked as a servant in their house, and they recognized his musical talent early, 
                advancing him a small amount of money to buy his first cornet.

                In this essay, which stretches on for 77 pages, Armstrong enshrines a number of other elements of his personal mythology. 
                He reports his birthday as July 4, 1900, an apocryphal but symbolic date he was fond of using. 
                And he describes the importance of the Storyville neighborhood where he was raised, 
                and where much of early jazz was developed.
                <br><br>
                Just months after he wrote this piece, he died in his sleep at age 69. This story would be collected in a posthumous book, 
                <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/louis-armstrong-in-his-own-words-9780195140460?cc=us&lang=en&">

                Armstrong's creative hobbies outside writing were less easily wrangled for posterity or publication. One example: the hundreds of

                Starting in the early 1950s, few pieces of paper were safe from the blade of Armstrong's scissors: magazines, risqué photographs, 
                even a Christmas card from Richard Nixon wound up cut and collaged. Most of the time, he taped his collages onto reel-to-reel tape boxes; 
                they were purely decorative. Elsewhere, he turned larger pieces of paper into what amounted to a personal hall of fame.
                <br><br>
                In one such collage, he crammed a page with almost a dozen photos of Jackie Robinson. On another, Duke Ellington and Kermit Parker, 
                the first black man to run for governor as a Democrat in Louisiana, gaze toward each other from across the page.

                And on the collage above, a photograph of King Oliver is pasted inside an image of Armstrong's head, as if to make clear how 
                much Armstrong felt he owed to Oliver. To their left are two other trumpeters: Bix Beiderbecke, a prominent jazz star of the 1920s, 
                and Bunny Berigan, who drew heavily from Armstrong's influence, both as a trumpeter and a vocalist. Other musicians pictured include 
                Duke Ellington, the R&B vocalist Ruth Brown, and Big Sid Catlett, an influential early drummer who played with Armstrong's big band 
                at the height of its popularity.

                In a far corner of the image, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had been president around the time when most of these musicians were stars,

                When Armstrong died in 1971, his wife, Lucille, ensured that the house they shared in Corona, Queens — the place where he recorded his tapes, 
                made collages and wrote his manifold letters and notes — remained exactly as he had left it.
                <br><br>
                At first, Armstrong didn't want the house. But Lucille bought it in 1943, the year after they married, while he was on a lengthy tour. 
                He eventually fell in love with the narrow two-story brick home, and with the working-class block into which it was tucked. 
                Armstrong — whose four marriages never resulted in a child — proudly became an avuncular presence on the block, and bragged in a 1971 
                manuscript that he had watched three generations grow up around him. Years later, when Lucille eventually wanted to upgrade, 
                he insisted they stay. So she made improvements. The ornate, Fifth Avenue-rate bathroom is a prime example. And the “Throne,” 
                as Armstrong called it in his writing, was of prime import.

                Armstrong took health and diet very seriously, partly because of having been raised by a single mother who focused, 
                for lack of a doctor, on keeping her children healthy with natural remedies. After Lucille introduced him to Swiss Kriss, 
                an herbal laxative, he became a zealous proponent and offered his endorsement for free. The couple wrote a diet plan 
                that called for regular consumption of Swiss Kriss, and they circulated it among friends and fans along with a comical 
                photo of Armstrong seated on his decked-out Queens toilet, with his “Satchmo-Slogan” printed below: “Leave it All Behind Ya.”

                Starting in December 1950, Armstrong used a tape recorder to capture casual conversations, ambient road hangouts, 
                interviews with journalists, radio broadcasts he liked and more. Most often, though, he would simply record his 
                shellac and vinyl discs to tape, consolidating the music and making it easier to carry. He kept careful documentation 
                of the track lists, and together the tapes and their accompanying lists provide a revealing glimpse into his broad music tastes.
                <br><br>
                Ever the careful documenter, Armstrong wrote out a playlist anytime he recorded music to tape — whether it was a recording 
                of his own concert, a dub of an entire album or a more piecemeal mixtape.
                <br><br>
                The range of his listening is striking. He was as likely to listen to the Beatles as he was to Rachmaninoff. On one playlist, 
                the old vaudeville singer Al Jolson and Miles Davis butt up against each other. “The man was obsessed with all kinds of music,
                ” Riccardi said. “Anywhere he'd go — if he'd go to South America, he'd bring back South-American records. If he went to Africa, 
                he'd bring back African records. He'd go to record stores everywhere.”

                On a disc marked “Reel 24,” he is listening mostly to the bebop musicians that had succeeded him in the jazz spotlight of 
                the 1940s and '50s. On the audio of the tape itself, you can hear him announcing the tunes like a radio D.J.
                <br><br>
                
                After that tape plays, Armstrong introduces another: a bootleg recording of a jam session at Minton's, the venue where 
                bebop was born. After he plays it, he expresses approval. “Cats jumpin', man,” he says, apparently unperturbed 
                by the beboppers' sometimes-ambivalent relationship to his own legacy. Later on, he jumps to a track of his own, 
                “Among My Souvenirs.” In the handwritten playlist, Armstrong closely notates each turn in the tape, including the moment 
                when he pauses to mention the children playing outside.
                <br><br>
                
                These are the children that Armstrong said he was thinking of when he sang his most famous song, “What a Wonderful World.” 
                Here we have their very voices, documented for all time.
