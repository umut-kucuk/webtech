    <h2>The purpose and the Scope of the Project</h2>
    <p>This project is carried out by Lucas Dans, Mathias Rønning, Umut
      Kucuk
      for the final exam of the Web Technologies lesson held by
      professor
      Fabio Vitali at the University of Bologna
      Three different article has been choosen in the fields of
      cinema, music
      and comic books.</p>

    <h2>Styles</h2>

      
    <h3>Medieval</h3>
    <p>
      In these centuriess, the style of the books of the time was centered on handwritten manuscripts,
      since the first printing press wasn't created until the mid-nineteenth century. The styles are very
      different, especially depending on where in the world they take place, since
      most of them were styles established by religions and cultures.
      For our style we have chosen one that resembles a handmade manuscript,
      where the first letter of each paragraph is going to be a very ornamented one and bigger than the rest,
      the font used in the text is of humanistic type
      <br>
      The general design is inspired by the classic design of a column that was made from the year 1500.
      The layout is positioned slightly to the left side of the page, with a wider right margin,
      uses the golden section to determine the text area and the Fibonacci sequence to arrive at
      relative margin sizes (inner margin 3em ; top and outer margins 5em; bottom margin 8em)
      For the background image used, you can see how it is a whiter page, especially in comparison with the
      more medieval manuscripts that gave more effect of darkness. Looking for something simple and elegant
    </p>
    <h4>Color Palette and Layout</h4>

    <div class="palette">
      <div class="color-palette11">soft orange</div>
      <div class="color-palette12">black</div>
    </div>

    <div class="d-flex flex-row">

      <div class="p-2 col">
        <img src="/resources/images/doc_medieval_2.png" width="100px">

        <img src="/resources/images/doc_medieval_3.png" width="50px">
      </div>

    </div>

    <br><br>

    <h3>1820s</h3>
    <p>
      During the XIX century, the full industrialization of printing occurs thanks to the steam press.
      Where for example the Time of London was capable of producing 1,100 impressions per hour.
      <br>
      For our design we are going to take as a reference a newspaper of the time such as the New York Times or the Time of London
      mentioned above. Therefore, from the background image an image is taken as an old newspaper effect, but at the same time keeping the white.
      For the letters of the headings we will use a Victorian type font with very ornamented letters and
      ornate, while for the paragraphs we will use a large letter to start them and for the text a Serif type
      with an equal alignment of text in each line and separating them into 4 columns with little separation between them, resembling magazine or newspaper articles of the time

    <h3>1920s</h3>
    <p>At the beginning of the 20th century, new art movements were emerging in Europe.
      The most prominent movements were Constructivism and Dadaism.
      These movements, which emerged especially after the first world war, were shaped around an anti-war mentality.
      They criticized the destruction and barbarism of the war through art.</p>
    <p>In the 1920s, the New Objectivity (Die Neue Sachlichkeit) movement was born in Germany as a reaction against
      expressionism.
      This movement, which was started by George Grosz and Otto Dix and continued until the 1930s-40s, is characterized
      as a sarcastic and social criticism with a realistic style.
      It is difficult to say that this movement had a direct impact on style in print.
      However, the founders of the movement later signed important works in the Dadaism movement.
      It can be said that it was a pioneering movement because it was a reaction against expressionism. </p>
    <p>Dadaism is an artistic and cultural movement that started during the First World War.
      Dadism is against the barbarism and destruction created by the war. The rejection of the current understanding of
      art is its main character.
      Dada is a movement against aestheticism and finds bourgeois values disgusting.
      It is intended to surprise and shock the public.
      Emphasizing words and even individual letters and numbers in the layout, including unusual compositions and
      typographic innovations are the important features of this movement.
      In this period, the grotesque font stands out as the font that represents the proletarians and the universal
      spirit of solidarity of the new industrial society.</p>
    <p>Another important movement of the early 20th century is De Stijl.
      It was born in the Netherlands in 1917 as a design movement. The pioneers of this movement were Theo Van Doesburg
      and Piet Mondrian.
      De Stijl artists explored the mathematical expression of the universe and the anatomy of nature.
      When we look at the works in modern art movements, it is seen that geometric forms are used as an indicator of
      science and rationality.
      This approach was taken further in De Stijl, and it was brought to form constructs consisting only of verticals
      and horizontals, rejecting even the use of curves and diagonals, with the thought that it reflects subjectivity.
      Designers of this movement used asymmetrical compositions in their designs; the color red, which creates a strong
      expression unit together with black and serif-free fonts, was used frequently.</p>
    <p>Another important movement of the 1920s, of which some characteristic features are included in the study, is the
      Bauhaus. Shapes, primary colors and lines are important symbols of this movement.</p>
    <p>In order to reflect the general atmosphere of the 1920s, a layout was created by being influenced by all these
      movements. Grotesque font is used. In order to break some lines in the text, some words are positioned vertically.
      The pictures in the study are also placed in the layout in an inclined way.
      In addition to these, some geometric shapes are included in the composition.
      Linear borders are used in some paragraphs.
      All these have been designed in a certain composition but with a deliberately irregular understanding.
      In this sense, Dadaist thought and philosophy were tried to be reflected, but compositional aesthetics was not
      completely abandoned.
    </p>
    <h4>Color Palette and Layout</h4>
    <p>The color palette consists of light salmon, dark blue and dark red. When the magazines of the period are
      considered, it is striking that these color combinations are frequently used.</p>
    <div class="palette">
      <div class="color-palette1">#ffa07a</div>
      <div class="color-palette2">#00008B</div>
      <div class="color-palette3">#8b0000</div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>Shocking and unexpected features are the main characteristic of Dadaism. Demonstrating individual words out of
      the pharagraf and the grotesque typography are also quite important for the layout.</p>

<br><br>

    <h3>1980s</h3>
    <p>One of the common features of journals in modern publishing in the second half of the 20th century is that a very
      flat and minimal understanding prevails.
      When we examine the layouts of the mainstream magazines, especially in the 80s, it is possible to encounter
      extremely clean, tidy and modern designs.</p>
    <p>While the modern and regular designs are also extremely impressive, a design style has been adopted based on the
      video game magazines published in the 80s in order to go beyond the ordinary.
      With a combination of the magical and colorful world of arcade and fun video game magazine designs, it is aimed to
      reveal a character that is contrary to the minimalist understanding of the mainstream publishing in 80s.</p>
    <p>VT323 font is used to create an arcade game-like design. A background consisting of a pinball table was chosen to
      support this layout.</p>
    <h4>Color Palette and Layout</h4>
    <p>A combination of dark and pastel colors chosen to reflect the ambiance of the arcade saloons</p>
    <div class="palette">
      <div class="color-palette4">#fe4b63</div>
      <div class="color-palette5">#382326</div>
      <div class="color-palette6">#fef7ed</div>

    </div>

    <br><br>

    <h3>2000s</h3>
    <p>
      Around the millennium change of year 2000 the age of digitalization was inn full force
      and much of the media consumption was being moved to the internet. However, analog formats
      were still going strong, and printed magazines were still popular.
      The 2000s typographical theme represents a printed magazine with inspiration
      taken from magazines of this period. Magazines such as Vanity Fair,
      Vogue and TIME were referenced as examples of the typographical period, and as a consequence
      the final style resembles that of these magazines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The typographical style of the referenced magazines share common layout themes, such as
      each line being justified to the same width, giving a sense of structure and symmetry.
      In addition, a dropped capital is often used for specific paragraphs, giving greater weight
      to them and allowing easier reading. When it comes to line height and margin there is greater
      variation, however the text is commonly densely packed to fit more text onto the page. We
      have therefore chosen a line height of 1.5rem and a margin of 0 between the paragraphs, instead
      using an indentation of 2rem to differentiate them.
      To resemble the look of a magazine, a clean image of paper is used as background for the
      articles.
    </p>
    <h4>Color Palette and Layout</h4>
    <p>
      The color palette chosen is a simple one; black, white and red. This palette is commonly used among
      all the referenced magazines, and examples from the referenced magazines are shown in the images
      below.
    </p>
    <div class="palette">
      <div class="color-palette7">red</div>
      <div class="color-palette12">black</div>
      <div class="color-palette13">white</div>
    </div>
    <div class="d-flex flex-row">

    </div>

    <br><br>
    
    <h3>Future</h3>
    <p>
      Predicting the future is never an easy endeavour, though the attempt to do so
      allows for creative interpretations. Our idea of the future is a sci-fi/dystopian
      one with inspiration drawn from films such as Blade Runner. In this future, media
      is projected on to screens with bright and vibrant colors, however with dark background.
    </p>
    <p>
      The typographical style used for the futuristic theme is a minimalistic one, having
      a dark background with bright text to create contrast. The text has a colored shadow
      giving a glowing effect, resembling that of neon signs or projected light. The fonts
      used are Ailerons and Orbitron, two futuristic fonts with a rather minimalistic design.
    </p>
    <h4>Color Palette and Layout</h4>
    <p>
      The chosen color palette consists of bright, emissive red and blue colors on top of a black background
      to create contrast and an effect of light.
    </p>
    <div class="palette">
      <div class="color-palette8">emissive blue</div>
      <div class="color-palette9">emissive red</div>
      <div class="color-palette12">black</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Below are some reference images showing the inspiration for the style.
